      "Contrary to spontaneous yawning-an ancient phenomenon common to vertebrates-contagious yawning (elicited by others' yawns) has been found only in highly social species and may reflect an emotional inter-individual connection. We investigated yawn contagion in the domestic pig, Sus scrofa. Owing to the complex socio-emotional and cognitive abilities of Sus scrofa, we posited that yawn contagion could be present in this species (Prediction 1) and influenced by individual/social factors (Prediction 2). In June-November 2018, on 104 semi-free ranging adolescent/adult pigs, 224 videos were recorded for video analysis on yawning. Kinship information was refined via genetic analyses. Statistical elaboration was conducted via GLMMs and non-parametric/randomization/cross-tabulation tests. We found yawn contagion in Sus scrofa, as it was more likely that pigs yawned when perceiving rather than not perceiving (yawning/control condition) others' yawns (response peak in the first out of three minutes). Yawn contagion was more likely: (1) in response to males' yawns; (2) as the age increased; (3) within short distance (1 m); (4) between full siblings, with no significant association between kinship and distance. The influence of kinship suggests that-as also hypothesized for Homo sapiens-yawn contagion might be linked with emotional communication and possibly contagion.\n",
      "Yawning is an involuntary action that begins with a slow opening of the mouth with inhalation, followed by a maximum gaping phase, and ends with a short exhalation and the closing of the mouth. A wide variety of vertebrate species, including humans, yawn. Here, we report underwater yawn-like behavior in three captive common bottlenose dolphins, inferred from 119-h of observations. Five cases of yawn-like behavior were selected out of 2045 open-mouth behaviors, after removing intentional open-mouth behaviors. Yawn-like behaviors were chosen that had a mouth open-close duration ratio of ≤ 1 (duration of Phase 3, the period of mouth closing after maximum opening, divided by the duration of Phase 1, the period of mouth opening from start to maximum opening). Naïve human evaluators selected \"yawn-like\" behaviors. All five cases of yawn-like behavior occurred during inactive periods, similar to human yawns. In three of the five cases, inactivity levels significantly decreased within 4 min after the yawn-like behavior; therefore, yawn-like behavior in dolphins may increase their arousal level in drowsy states. Thus, the yawn-like behavior of dolphins, without breathing, is similar to yawning in terrestrial animals, including humans.\n",
      "Yawn contagion occurs when individuals yawn in response to the yawn of others (triggers). This is the first account of yawn contagion in wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada), a monkey species that shows yawn contagion in captivity and is organized in core units (one-male/bachelor groups) forming multilevel associations. In a population of geladas from the Kundi plateau (Ethiopia) we found that the yawning response was highest when geladas could perceive a triggering yawn, which confirms that yawn contagion is present in the wild. Yawn duration, mouth-opening degree and presence/absence of vocalisation (possibly modulating yawn detectability) did not affect the likelihood of contagion. Males and females, known to be both implicated in movement initiation within groups, were similarly powerful as yawn triggers. Instead, group membership and responder sex had a significant role in shaping the phenomenon. Yawn contagion was highest between individuals belonging to different core units and males were most likely to respond to others' yawns. Because males have a non-negligible role in inter-group coordination, our results suggest that yawn contagion may have a communicative function that goes beyond the basic unit level.\n",
      "Yawning is a phylogenetically old behaviour that can be observed in most vertebrate species from foetal stages to old age. The origin and function of this conspicuous phenomenon have been subject to speculations for centuries. Here, we review the experimental evidence for each of these hypotheses. It is found that theories ascribing a physiological role to yawning (such as the respiratory, arousal, or thermoregulation hypotheses) lack evidence. Conversely, the notion that yawning has a communicative function involved in the transmission of drowsiness, boredom, or mild psychological stress receives increasing support from research in different fields. In humans and some other mammals, yawning is part of the action repertoire of advanced empathic and social skills.\n",
      "Yawning is a primitive and stereotyped motor action involving orofacial, laryngeal, pharyngeal, thoracic and abdominal muscles. Contagious yawning, an involuntarily action induced by viewing or listening to others' yawns, has been demonstrated in human and several non-human species. Previous studies with humans showed that infants and preschool children, socially separated during video experiments, were not infected by others' yawns. Here, we tested the occurrence of yawn contagion in 129 preschool children (ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 years) belonging to five different classes by video recording them in their classrooms during the ordinary school activities. As it occurs in adult humans, children of all ages were infected by others' yawns within the 2 min after the perception of the stimulus. The yawn contagion occurred earlier than previously thought. For children, it appears that the natural social setting is more conducive to yawn contagion than the inherently artificial experimental approach. Moreover, children's gender did not affect the level of contagious yawning. The neural, emotional and behavioural traits of preschool children are probably not sufficiently mature to express variability between boys and girls; nevertheless, children appeared to be already well equipped with the 'neural toolkit' necessary for expressing yawn contagion.\n",
      "Gallup (this issue) believes that our recent review on the function of yawning (Guggisberg et al., 2010) is unbalanced and that it ignores evidence for his thermoregulation hypothesis. Here we address these criticisms and show them to be untenable. While we never claimed that the social hypothesis of yawning has \"definite experimental support\", we emphasize the importance of experimental evidence for specific effects of yawns when considering why we yawn. The only specific effect of yawning that could be demonstrated so far is its contagiousness in humans, some non-human primates, and possibly dogs, whereas all studies investigating physiological consequences of yawns were unable to observe specific yawn-induced effects in the individual of any species. The argument that from an evolutionary perspective, yawns must have a \"primitive\" physiological function arises from imprecise reasoning.\n",
      "Yawning is highly contagious, yet both its proximate mechanism(s) and its ultimate causation remain poorly understood. Scholars have suggested a link between contagious yawning (CY) and sociality due to its appearance in mostly social species. Nevertheless, as findings are inconsistent, CY's function and evolution remains heavily debated. One way to understand the evolution of CY is by studying it in hominids. Although CY has been found in chimpanzees and bonobos, but is absent in gorillas, data on orangutans are missing despite them being the least social hominid. Orangutans are thus interesting for understanding CY's phylogeny. Here, we experimentally tested whether orangutans yawn contagiously in response to videos of conspecifics yawning. Furthermore, we investigated whether CY was affected by familiarity with the yawning individual (i.e. a familiar or unfamiliar conspecific and a 3D orangutan avatar). In 700 trials across 8 individuals, we found that orangutans are more likely to yawn in response to yawn videos compared to control videos of conspecifics, but not to yawn videos of the avatar. Interestingly, CY occurred regardless of whether a conspecific was familiar or unfamiliar. We conclude that CY was likely already present in the last common ancestor of humans and great apes, though more converging evidence is needed.\n"

      "In primates, yawn contagion (the yawning response elicited by others' yawn) is variably influenced by individual (e.g., sex, age) and social factors (e.g., familiarity) and possibly linked to interindividual synchronization, coordination, and emotional contagion. Two out of three studies on yawn contagion in bonobos (Pan paniscus), found the presence of the phenomenon with mixed results concerning the effect of familiarity and no replication on its modulating factors. To address this puzzling issue, we recorded all occurrences data on yawn contagion in a captive bonobo group (March-June 2021; 18 individuals; La Vallée des Singes, France). Contrary to chimpanzees and humans, the number of triggering yawns increased contagion, possibly owing to a higher stimulus threshold. This aspect may explain the interindividual variability observed in yawn contagion rates. In subjects under weaning, we did not detect yawn contagion and, as it occurs in certain human cohorts, yawn contagion declined with age, possibly due to reduced sensitivity to others. Females responded more than males and elicited more responses from females when showing sexual swelling. As reproductive females are central in bonobo society, our results support the hypothesis that-as in other Hominini-the most influential sex can influence yawn contagion. The relationship quality (measured via grooming/play) did not affect yawn contagion, possibly due to bonobos' xenophilic nature. Overall, this study confirms the presence of yawn contagion in bonobos and introduces new elements on its modulating factors, pointing toward the necessity of cross-group studies.\n",
      "While the origin of yawning appears to be physiologic, yawns may also hold a derived communicative function in social species. In particular, the arousal reduction hypothesis states that yawning signals to others that the actor is experiencing a down regulation of arousal and vigilance. If true, seeing another individual yawn might enhance the vigilance of observers to compensate for the reduced mental processing of the yawner. This was tested in humans by assessing how exposure to yawning stimuli alters performance on visual search tasks for detecting snakes (a threatening stimulus) and frogs (a neutral stimulus). In a repeated-measures design, 38 participants completed these tasks separately after viewing yawning and control videos. Eye-tracking was used to measure detection latency and distractor fixation frequency. Replicating previous evolutionary-based research, snakes were detected more rapidly than frogs across trials. Moreover, consistent with the view that yawning holds a distinct signaling function, there were significant interactions for both detection latency and distractor fixation frequency showing that vigilance was selectively enhanced following exposure to yawns. That is, after viewing videos of other people yawning, participants detected snakes more rapidly and were less likely to fixate on distractor frogs during trials. These findings provide the first experimental evidence for a social function to yawning in any species, and imply the presence of a previously unidentified psychological adaptation for preserving group vigilance.\n",
      "Guggisberg et al. (2010) reviewed the evidence for the origin and function of yawning, and conclude that theories describing a physiological role lack support. Instead, they argue research supports the notion that yawning has a communicative function. Contrary to the authors' claim that the social/communication hypothesis has the \"best experimental evidence\", there is in fact no definitive experimental support for the predictions of this model. Furthermore, the authors claim to take an evolutionary perspective, but sufficient examples across the comparative (non-primate) literature are missing, and they fail to acknowledge phylogenic history. Due to the ubiquity of this behavior across vertebrates, and the regularity of its occurrence in a number of different physiological states and social contexts, it is likely that instead of serving one purpose, yawning is multifunctional across a number of species. The most parsimonious explanation for the origin of yawning suggests that any social value is a derived feature, while the primitive feature or function is physiological. The current paper addresses these concerns, and identifies a number of other weaknesses in the social/communication hypothesis as a global explanation for the origin and function of yawning.\n",
      "Research indicates that the motor action pattern of yawning functions to promote cortical arousal and state change through enhanced intracranial circulation and brain cooling. Because the magnitude of this response likely corresponds to the degree of neurophysiological change, we hypothesized that interspecies variation in yawn duration would correlate with underlying neurological differences. Using openly accessible data, we show that both the mean and variance in yawn duration are robust predictors of mammalian brain weight and cortical neuron number (ρ-values > 0.9). Consistent with these effects, primates tend to have longer and more variable yawn durations compared with other mammals. Although yawning has long been considered a stereotyped action pattern, these findings reveal substantial variation in this response and highlight the importance of measuring yawn duration in future research.\n",
      "Considerable variation exists in the contagiousness of yawning, and numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the proximate mechanisms involved in this response. Yet, findings within the psychological literature are mixed, with many studies conducted on relatively small and homogeneous samples. Here, we aimed to replicate and extend upon research suggesting a negative relationship between psychopathic traits and yawn contagion in community samples. In the largest study of contagious yawning to date (N = 458), which included both university students and community members from across 50 nationalities, participants completed an online study in which they self-reported on their yawn contagion to a video stimulus and completed four measures of psychopathy: the primary and secondary psychopathy scales from the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRPS), the psychopathy construct from the Dirty Dozen, and the Psychopathic Personality Traits Scale (PPTS). Results support previous findings in that participants that yawned contagiously tended to score lower on the combined and primary measures of psychopathy. That said, tiredness was the strongest predictor across all models. These findings align with functional accounts of spontaneous and contagious yawning and a generalized impairment in overall patterns of behavioral contagion and biobehavioral synchrony among people high in psychopathic traits.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that yawning evolved as a brain cooling mechanism. Given that larger brains have greater thermolytic needs and brain temperature is determined in part by heat production from neuronal activity, it was hypothesized that animals with larger brains and more neurons would yawn longer to produce comparable cooling effects. To test this, we performed the largest study on yawning ever conducted, analyzing 1291 yawns from 101 species (55 mammals; 46 birds). Phylogenetically controlled analyses revealed robust positive correlations between yawn duration and (1) brain mass, (2) total neuron number, and (3) cortical/pallial neuron number in both mammals and birds, which cannot be attributed solely to allometric scaling rules. These relationships were similar across clades, though mammals exhibited considerably longer yawns than birds of comparable brain and body mass. These findings provide further evidence suggesting that yawning is a thermoregulatory adaptation that has been conserved across amniote evolution.\n",

      "Yawn contagion, possibly a form of emotional contagion, occurs when a subject yawns in response to others' yawns. Yawn contagion has been reported in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, geladas, wolves, and dogs. In these species, individuals form strong, long-term relationships and yawn contagion is highest between closely bonded individuals. This study focuses on the possible expression of yawn contagion in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Gorillas share with geladas a similar basic social structure (one dominant male and several adult females with offspring) and differ from bonobos and chimpanzees, which live in multimale-multifemale societies. Gorillas stand out because they are spatially aggregated but show especially low levels of social affiliation. If the expression of yawn contagion is linked to the investment of animals in establishing long-term social relationships, the phenomenon should not be detected in gorillas (social relationship hypothesis). For the first time, we applied to the same subjects the naturalistic approach typically used in ethology (all occurrences behavioral sampling) and the experimental approach typically used in psychology (response to video stimuli). During the video demonstration (avatar yawn/control; unfamiliar gorilla yawn/control), we checked for the attentional state of the subjects. Anxiety-related self-directed behaviors were recorded in all conditions and settings. We failed to detect yawn contagion in both naturalistic and experimental settings, with yawning being possibly associated with anxiety during video shows (revealed by the increased frequency of self-directed behaviors). In conclusion, yawn contagion may be a socially modulated phenomenon that remains largely unexpressed when individuals share weak social affiliation.

      "The ability to share others' emotions, or empathy, is crucial for complex social interactions. Clinical, psychological, and neurobiological clues suggest a link between yawn contagion and empathy in humans (Homo sapiens). However, no behavioral evidence has been provided so far. We tested the effect of different variables (e.g., country of origin, sex, yawn characteristics) on yawn contagion by running mixed models applied to observational data collected over 1 year on adult (>16 years old) human subjects. Only social bonding predicted the occurrence, frequency, and latency of yawn contagion. As with other measures of empathy, the rate of contagion was greatest in response to kin, then friends, then acquaintances, and lastly strangers. Related individuals (r≥0.25) showed the greatest contagion, in terms of both occurrence of yawning and frequency of yawns. Strangers and acquaintances showed a longer delay in the yawn response (latency) compared to friends and kin. This outcome suggests that the neuronal activation magnitude related to yawn contagion can differ as a function of subject familiarity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that yawn contagion is primarily driven by the emotional closeness between individuals and not by other variables, such as gender and nationality.\n",
      "Contagious yawning is a common phenomenon affecting upwards of 60% of healthy humans. It has also been observed, at a lesser rate, in great apes and other primates. Here I summarize the suggestion that contagious yawning is a primitive expression of social cognition, namely empathy. Susceptibility to contagious yawning is correlated with the speed in recognizing one's own face, theory of mind processing, and is also associated with activation in regions of the brain that have been associated with social cognitive processes. This suggests that contagious yawning may be an evolutionarily old process that begot a higher level of social cognition in certain species.\n",
      "In humans, the distribution of yawn contagion is shaped by social closeness with strongly bonded pairs showing higher levels of contagion than weakly bonded pairs. This ethological finding led the authors to hypothesize that the phenomenon of yawn contagion may be the result of certain empathic abilities, although in their most basal form. Here, for the first time, we show the capacity of bonobos (Pan paniscus) to respond to yawns of conspecifics. Bonobos spontaneously yawned more frequently during resting/relaxing compared to social tension periods. The results show that yawn contagion was context independent suggesting that the probability of yawning after observing others' yawns is not affected by the propensity to engage in spontaneous yawns. As it occurs in humans, in bonobos the yawing response mostly occurred within the first minute after the perception of the stimulus. Finally, via a Linear Mixed Model we tested the effect of different variables (e.g., sex, rank, relationship quality) on yawn contagion, which increased when subjects were strongly bonded and when the triggering subject was a female. The importance of social bonding in shaping yawn contagion in bonobos, as it occurs in humans, is consistent with the hypothesis that empathy may play a role in the modulation of this phenomenon in both species. The higher frequency of yawn contagion in presence of a female as a triggering subject supports the hypothesis that adult females not only represent the relational and decisional nucleus of the bonobo society, but also that they play a key role in affecting the emotional states of others.\n",
      "Yawning is a stereotyped motor behavior characterized by deep inhalation and associated dilation of the respiratory tract, pronounced jaw opening, and facial grimacing. The frequency of spontaneous yawning varies over the diurnal cycle, peaking after waking and before sleep. Yawning can also be elicited by seeing or hearing another yawn, or by thinking about yawning, a phenomenon known as \"contagious yawning\". Yawning is mediated by a distributed network of brainstem and supratentorial brain regions, the components of which are shared with other airway behaviors including respiration, swallowing, and mastication. Nevertheless, the possibility of behavioral coordination between yawning and other brainstem-mediated functions has not been examined. Here we show, with a double-blind methodology, a greater-than-fivefold increase in rest (saliva) swallowing rate during the 10-s period immediately following contagious yawning elicited in 14 adult humans through the viewing of videotaped yawn stimuli. Sixty-five percent of yawns were followed by a swallow within 10 s and swallows accounted for 26 % of all behaviors produced during this post-yawn period. This novel finding of a tight temporal coupling between yawning and swallowing provides preliminary evidence that yawning and swallowing are physiologically related, thus extending current models of upper airway physiology and neurophysiology. Moreover, our finding suggests the possibility that yawning plays a role in eliciting rest swallowing, a view not considered in previous theories of yawning. As such, the present demonstration of a temporal association between yawning and swallowing motivates a re-examination of the longstanding question, \"Why do we yawn?\".\n",

      "Yawning is contagious: Watching another person yawn may trigger us to do the same. Here we studied brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects watched videotaped yawns. Significant increases in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, specific to yawn viewing as contrasted to viewing non-nameable mouth movements, were observed in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) and bilaterally in the anterior STS, in agreement with the high affinity of STS to social cues. However, no additional yawn-specific activation was observed in Broca's area, the core region of the human mirror-neuron system (MNS) that matches action observation and execution. Thus, activation associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS, in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts-rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding. The subjects' self-reported tendency to yawn covaried negatively with activation of the left periamygdalar region, suggesting a connection between yawn contagiousness and amygdalar activation.\n",
      "Chasmology is the scientific study of yawning. Though its official history started only recently, its unofficial history stretches back to antiquity. This chapter outlines the history and current state of chasmology, through textual research and analysis, and offers a vision of its future. Particular emphasis is placed upon the author's favorite theory: the hidden sexuality of the human yawn. The 'First Law of Chasmology' states that a yawn occurs: (1) if the yawner cannot do what he would like to do, or (2) if the yawner must do something that he would rather not do. The 'Second Law of Chasmology', which is a special instance of the more general First Law, states that the yawn has an erotic and even a sexual aspect. A critical mass of proof for the validity of this Second Law is derived from various sciences and disciplines, ranging from theology and (the history of) art to ethology and pharmacology. The process of evidencing the Second Law has also established chasmology as an emerging science, i.e. a science that uses the data and information of primary sciences to make a synthesis that transforms and transcends the original scope and results of the auxiliary disciplines. The Second Law allows at least two concrete predictions about future corroborations or refutations in chasmological research.\n",

      "The purpose of this study was to take a critical look at a voice therapy technique known as the yawn-sigh. The voiced sigh as an approach in voice therapy has had increased use in recent years, particularly with problems of vocal hyperfunction. In this study, the physiology of the yawn-sigh was studied with video nasoendoscopy in eight normal subjects; their taped voices were also studied acoustically for possible fundamental frequency and format changes in producing selected vowels under normal and sigh conditions. Although each subject was given a model by the examiner of a yawn-sigh, one of the eight subjects could not produce a true yawn-sigh. Endoscopic findings for seven of the eight subjects performing the yawn-sigh demonstrated retracted elevation of the tongue, a lower positioning of the larynx, and a widened pharynx. Acoustic analyses for the seven subjects producing the sigh found a marked lowering of the second and third formants. Implications for using the yawn-sigh in voice therapy are given, such as using a modified \"silent\" yawn-sigh, as an easy method for producing greater vocal tract relaxation.\n"

      "Contagious yawning has been reported for humans, dogs and several non-human primate species, and associated with empathy in humans and other primates. Still, the function, development and underlying mechanisms of contagious yawning remain unclear. Humans and dogs show a developmental increase in susceptibility to yawn contagion, with children showing an increase around the age of four, when also empathy-related behaviours and accurate identification of others' emotions begin to clearly evince. Explicit tests of yawn contagion in non-human apes have only involved adult individuals and examined the existence of conspecific yawn contagion. Here we report the first study of heterospecific contagious yawning in primates, and the ontogeny of susceptibility thereto in chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. We examined whether emotional closeness, defined as attachment history with the yawning model, affected the strength of contagion, and compared the contagiousness of yawning to nose-wiping. Thirty-three orphaned chimpanzees observed an unfamiliar and familiar human (their surrogate human mother) yawn, gape and nose-wipe. Yawning, but not nose-wiping, was contagious for juvenile chimpanzees, while infants were immune to contagion. Like humans and dogs, chimpanzees are subject to a developmental trend in susceptibility to contagious yawning, and respond to heterospecific yawn stimuli. Emotional closeness with the model did not affect contagion. The familiarity-biased social modulatory effect on yawn contagion previously found among some adult primates, seem to only emerge later in development, or be limited to interactions with conspecifics. The influence of the 'chameleon effect', targeted vs. generalised empathy, perspective-taking and visual attention on contagious yawning is discussed.\n",
      "Yawning is a fascinating physiological behaviour that has been poorly addressed except in old medical books. Whereas the purpose of this behaviour is still not clearly identified, the ancient authors made it a clinical symptom, especially a psychological one. After presenting some current notions about yawning, we review publications on yawning written by physicians, from antiquity to the twentieth century, and, in particular, those dealing with psychological and psychiatric aspects.\n",
      "Yawning has become an interesting and curious scientific conundrum. Links between several neurological disorders can be found through the commonality of yawning episodes and contagious yawning. However, the reasons why we yawn are uncertain. Cortisol levels are known to rise during stress and fatigue; yawning may occur when we are under stress or tired. We do not know whether cortisol levels fluctuate during yawning. Potentially, yawning and cortisol levels may provide a valuable diagnostic tool and warning of untoward underlying neurological problems. A new hypothesis is proposed that links cortisol levels with yawning episodes.\n",
      "The ubiquitousness of normal yawning and the existence of abnormal yawning warrant an understanding of this reflex. Its mechanisms and functional role are not entirely known. A review of the literature reveals that yawning is a brain stem arousal reflex with both peripheral and central loops subserving reversal of brain hypoxia or hypoxemia. Behaviorally, yawning is a semi-involuntary act that occurs also because of loss of interest in the surroundings and it is not necessarily associated with fatigue. Socio-environmental factors can influence the emergence of yawning. Dopaminergic, acetylcholinergic, ACTHergic and oxytocinergic systems are involved in the generation and modulation of yawning in animal experimentation.\n",
      "Background: Although some research suggests that fetuses yawn, others disagree arguing that is it simple mouth opening. Furthermore there is no developmental account of fetal yawning compared with simple mouth opening. The aim of the present study was to establish in a repeated measures design the development of fetal yawning compared with simple mouth opening.\n",
      "Methodology/findings: Video recordings were made of the fetal face and upper torso visualized by means of 4D full frontal or facial profile ultrasound recordings. Fifteen healthy fetuses were scanned four times at 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks gestation. Yawning was distinguished from non-yawning in terms of the length of time it took to reach the apex of the mouth stretch, with yawns being defined as more than 50% of the total time observed. To assess changes in frequency, a Poisson mixed effects model was fitted to the count of number of yawn and simple mouth opening events with age and gender as fixed effects, and person as a random effect. For both yawns and simple mouth openings a smooth varying age effect was significant. The number of yawns observed declined with age from 28 weeks gestation, whereas simple mouth openings were less frequent and the decline was observed from 24 weeks. Gender was not significant either for yawn and simple mouth openings.\n",
      "Conclusions/significance: Yawning can be reliably distinguished from other forms of mouth opening with the potential of using yawning as an index of fetal healthy development.\n",
      "Research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have reduced empathy, as measured by an impaired contagious yawn response, compared to typically developing (TD) children. Other research has failed to replicate this finding, instead attributing this phenomenon to group differences in attention paid to yawn stimuli. A third possibility is that only a subgroup of children with ASD exhibits the impaired contagious yawn response, and that it can be identified biologically. Here we quantified blood concentrations of the \"social\" neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) and evaluated yawning behavior and attention rates during a laboratory task in children with ASD (N = 34) and TD children (N = 30) aged 6-12 years. No group difference in contagious yawning behavior was found. However, a blood OXT concentration × group (ASD vs. TD) interaction positively predicted contagious yawning behavior (F1,50 = 7.4987; P = 0.0085). Specifically, blood OXT concentration was positively related to contagious yawning behavior in children with ASD, but not in TD children. This finding was not due to delayed perception of yawn stimuli and was observed whether attention paid to test stimuli and clinical symptom severity were included in the analysis or not. These findings suggest that only a biologically defined subset of children with ASD exhibits reduced empathy, as measured by the impaired contagious yawn response, and that prior conflicting reports of this behavioral phenomenon may be attributable, at least in part, to variable mean OXT concentrations across different ASD study cohorts. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1156-1161. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: People with autism may contagiously yawn (i.e., yawn in response to another's yawn) less often than people without autism. We find that people with autism who have lower levels of blood oxytocin (OXT), a hormone involved in social behavior and empathy, show decreased contagious yawning, but those who have higher blood OXT levels do not differ in contagious yawning from controls. This suggests that decreased contagious yawning may only occur in a biologically defined subset of people with autism.\n",
      "Yawning is a stereotyped physiological behavior that can represent a sign or symptom of several conditions, such as stroke, parakinesia brachialis oscitans, parkinsonism, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. More rarely, it can occur in patients with intracranial hypertension, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, migraine, Chiari malformation type I, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Drug-induced yawning is an uncommon clinical condition and yawning in patients with autism or schizophrenia is very rare. The aim of this review is to describe in detail the occurrence of the phenomenon in such conditions, and its' phenomenology and pathophysiology.\n",
      "Fetal neurobehavioral patterns have been considered as indicators of nervous system development. Moreover, the capacity of 4-dimensional sonography to evaluate complex facial expressions allows recognition of common behaviors with which one can appreciate the prenatal functional development of the central nervous system. Using yawning as an example, we review this interpretation on the basis of knowledge derived from phylogeny and ontogeny. As a flip-flop switch, the reciprocal interactions between sleep- and wake-promoting brain regions allow the emergence of distinct states of arousal. By its ontogenic links with REM sleep, yawning appears to be a behavior which causes arousal reinforcement through the powerful stretching and the neuromuscular connections induced. Yawning indicates a harmonious progress in the development of both the brainstem and the peripheral neuromuscular function, testifying to the induction of an ultradian rhythm of vigilance. The lack of fetal yawn, frequently associated with lack of swallowing (associated or not with retrognathia), may be a key to predicting brainstem dysfunction after birth.\n"

      "Yawning continues to pose as a scientist's conundrum. Evidence is presented of yawning and contagious yawning in a number of different neurological disorders. Explanations are discussed in the context of disparate neurological disorders together with proposals for how theses findings may be linked. Thus, greater understanding of yawning and of neurological disorders may be achieved by exploring common neuro-chemical pathways and the involvement of neurotransmitters that are implicated in these different disorders. Finally, contagious yawning is discussed in the context of the susceptibility of persons and the similarity this presents with our understanding of the mechanisms involved in hypnosis.\n",
      "Despite a widespread familiarity with the often compelling urge to yawn after perceiving someone else yawn, an understanding of the neural mechanism underlying contagious yawning remains incomplete. In the present auditory fMRI study, listeners used a 4-point scale to indicate how much they felt like yawning following the presentation of a yawn, breath, or scrambled yawn sound. Not only were yawn sounds given significantly higher ratings, a trait positively correlated with each individual's empathy measure, but relative to control stimuli, random effects analyses revealed enhanced hemodynamic activity in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) in response to hearing yawns. Moreover, pIFG activity was greatest for yawn stimuli associated with high as opposed to low yawn ratings and for control sounds associated with equally high yawn ratings. These results support a relationship between contagious yawning and empathy and provide evidence for pIFG involvement in contagious yawning.

      "Yawning is a physiological behavior, an emotional stereotypy that indicates the homeostatic process of the mechanisms regulating rhythms, such as sleeping/waking, hunger/satiety or mating/relaxation, generated by the diencephalon. As with all physiological behaviors, its deregulation reveals disorders. In daily practice, yawning as a symptom is generally neglected. That is why we propose a wide overview of yawning in diseases, its consequences and significance.\n",

      "We review a growing body of medical and physiological evidence indicating that yawning may be a thermoregulatory mechanism, providing compensatory cooling when other provisions fail to operate favorably. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, migraine headaches, epilepsy, stress and anxiety, and schizophrenia have all be linked to thermoregulatory dysfunction and are often associated with instances of atypical yawning. Excessive yawning appears to be symptomatic of conditions that increase brain and/or core temperature, such as central nervous system damage, sleep deprivation and specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Yawning is also associated with drowsiness, and subjective ratings of sleepiness are correlated with increases in body temperature. This view of yawning has widespread application for the basic physiological understanding of thermoregulation as well as for the improved diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with abnormal thermoregulation.\n",
      "Yawning, laughing, and crying are normal physiological behaviors of humans in good health. As with all physiological behaviors, their deregulation can reveal disorders. Pathological yawning occurs in salvos of 10-20 successive yawns, and the number of yawns per day can exceed one hundred. After listing the functional etiologies, we will give the clinical keys for differentiating the most serious causes: iatrogenic, tumors, strokes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and intracranial hypertension. Sudden, uncontrollable episodes of emotional display involving pathological laughing and crying (PLC) may be encountered in various neurological diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy (cerebellar), cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injuries, mass lesions in the cerebellopontine junction, and epilepsy. After describing the pathophysiology of PLC and the use of diagnostic scales for PLC, we will discuss the current treatments.\n",
      "Since antiquity yawning has attracted a moderate interest among philosophers, psychologists, physiologists, as well as educators, moralists and physicians. Organisms from birds to men and from the womb to the deathbed were found to be displaying it. While sometimes satisfying to the producer, its display is offensive to the lay observer. Hippocrates had it on his lists of useful 'natures.' Aristotle dropped a few words on the matter. Boerhaave elevated its function to the intellect of animals. Haller has commented on its relation to the acoustic system, blood-flow, and baby sleep. Darwin mentioned it in connection with emotional behavior. Some modern authors praised its beneficial effects on respiration and smell. In the 1960s, Ashley Montagu tried to correct the contemporary failure to explain the behavior by the fact of raised CO2 and arterial compression. It also interested some neurologists, especially in its association with the encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s, with 'spasmodic yawning,' with epilepsy, not to speak of hysteria. As to boredom or its stimulus, a 40-page dissertation survives from the court of Frederick the Great of the 18th century condemning idleness, a subject that also inspired Blaise Pascal and William James. But in the Hindu world, public yawning was a religious offense.\n",
      "Two vocal qualities, twang and yawn, were synthesized and rated perceptually. The stimuli consisted of synthesized vocal productions of a sentence-length utterance 'ya ya ya ya ya,' which had speech-like intonation. In a continuum transformation from normal to twang, the area in the pharynx was gradually decreased, along with vocal tract shortening and a decreased open quotient in the glottal airflow. In a continuum transformation toward yawn, the area in the pharynx was gradually increased, along with vocal tract lengthening and an increased open quotient. The normal (untransformed) vocal tract area was pre-determined by earlier studies involving MRI scans of a human subject's vocal tract. Listeners were asked to rate (on a scale from 1-10) the 'amount of twang' in one listening session and the 'amount of yawn' in another listening session. Overall, the perception of twang increased directly with pharyngeal area narrowing, vocal tract shortening, and decreased open quotient. The perception of yawn increased with pharyngeal area widening, vocal tract lengthening, and increased open quotient. Adjustments of one parameter alone yielded less significant perceptual changes than the above combinations, with open quotient showing the greatest effect in isolation. Listeners demonstrated variable perceptions in both continua with poor inter-subject, intra-subject, and inter-group reliability.\n",
      "Yawning is a normal reflex triggered by arousal, drowsiness, boredom, hunger and emotional conditions and it is associated to several neurological diseases and drug abuse. Its wide presence in the phylogenetic vertebrate scale and even in human fetuses as young as 12 weeks directed the search for the common anatomic and biochemical mechanisms involved. The demonstration that yawning is not connected with high CO2 or low O2 blood levels left aside a prevalent metabolic hypothesis. Its close relationship with the sleep-wake cycle, specially in moments previous to falling asleep and after awaking has been related to changes in personal situation and activity. A single component of this reflex which is to be found exclusively in humans, is the fact that yawning is contagious. Thus, it is considered a component of the adaptative mechanism that is part of the surveillance reflex, becoming a significant paralinguistic evolutive expression aimed at protection and social cohesion. The common anatomical structures and neurochemical systems taking part in yawning, the sleep-wake cycle and the temporal lobe epilepsy may imply that yawning results from a set of protective systems induced by endogenous opiods which intervene in the inhibition and prevention of the temporal lobe epileptic seizures.\n"

      "Palagi et al. (Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 111:149-165, 2020) propose a multidisciplinary approach to the study of spontaneous mimicry, focusing on comparative research on facial mimicry and contagious yawning. In doing so, the authors highlight connections between these behaviors and emotional contagion. The aim of this commentary is to critically evaluate the link between contagious yawning and emotional contagion, address the role of attention in contagious yawning, and promote further research examining the sensory and perceptual factors driving variability in contagious yawning. Contrary to the position of Palagi et al., a strong matching between emotional contagion and contagious yawning has not been established. Variation in contagious yawning appears to be driven by biased attentional processes and yawn detection rather than emotional sharing.\n",
      "There is a long history of yawning in Old World monkeys being viewed as a form of communication, in particular, as a kind of threat. Yawning in agonistic and tense situations is seen in adult males, in particular, and it varies with male hormonal levels and social status. Experiments are reviewed that demonstrate operant control of the rate of yawning in adult male macaques, using food rewards. This indicates a degree of flexibility in the production of yawning. However, although adult male Old World monkeys often engage in 'canine contests', there is little evidence for the contagious yawning seen in humans. Experiments are reviewed showing that chimpanzees tested under comparable conditions to human adults, namely exposed to video sequences showing yawns, may yawn contagiously to yawn stimuli. Chimpanzees also yawn to computer animations of yawns. There is controversy in the literature over whether other species, including dogs and some monkeys, may also show contagious yawning. Further research is required to address unresolved issues. A hypothesis is put forward that in modern industrial society adults' natural pattern of yawning is inhibited, and that being reminded to yawn by seeing another individual yawn (contagious yawning) can help us to catch up on missed yawns. This would explain the lack of contagious yawning reported in young children and chimpanzees in natural surroundings, as these populations do not have the same social constraints on yawning.\n",
      "Clinical, neuropathological and neuroimaging research suggests that pathological changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) start many years before the emergence of motor signs. Since disease-modifying treatments are likely to be most effective when initiated early in the disease process, there has been significant interest in characterizing prodromal PD. Some people with PD describe autonomic symptoms at the time of diagnosis suggesting that autonomic dysfunction is a common feature of prodromal PD. Furthermore, subtle motor signs may be present and emerge prior to the time of diagnosis. We present a series of patients who, in the prodromal phase of PD, experienced the emergence of tremor initially only while yawning or straining at stool and discuss how early involvement of autonomic brainstem nuclei could lead to these previously unreported phenomena. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) plays a central role in autonomic control including bowel/bladder function, cardiovascular homeostasis and yawning and innervates multiple brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic functions (including brainstem reticular formation, locus ceruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and motor nucleus of the vagus). The PVN is affected in PD and evidence from related phenomena suggest that the PVN could increase tremor either by increasing downstream cholinergic activity on brainstem nuclei such as the reticular formation or by stimulating the locus ceruleus to activate the cerebellothalamocortical network via the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Aberrant cholinergic/noradrenergic transmission between these brainstem nuclei early in PD couldlead to tremor before the emergence of other parkinsonian signs, representing an early clinical clue to prodromal PD.\n",
      "Yawning is a physiological behavior and, as with all such behaviors, its deregulation is indicative of an underlying disorder. This chapter breaks this topic down into the types of yawning (incomplete, absent or excessive) and the direction of causality (triggering or relieving a disorder).\n",
      "Various studies and researchers have proposed a link between contagious yawning and empathy, yet the conceptual basis for the proposed connection is not clear and deserves critical evaluation. Therefore, we systematically examined the available empirical evidence addressing this association; i.e., a critical review of studies on inter-individual differences in contagion and self-reported values of empathy, differences in contagion based on familiarity or sex, and differences in contagion among individuals with psychological disorders, as well as developmental research, and brain imaging and neurophysiological studies. In doing so, we reveal a pattern of inconsistent and inconclusive evidence regarding the connection between contagious yawning and empathy. Furthermore, we identify study limitations and confounding variables, such as visual attention and social inhibition. Future research examining links between contagious yawning and empathy requires more rigorous investigation involving objective measurements to explicitly test for this connection.\n",
      "Contrary to spontaneous yawning, which is widespread in vertebrates and probably evolutionary ancient, contagious yawning-yawning triggered by others' yawns-is considered an evolutionarily recent phenomenon, found in species characterized by complex sociality. Whether the social asymmetry observed in the occurrence of contagious yawning is related to social and emotional attachment and may therefore reflect emotional contagion is a subject of debate. In this study we assessed whether yawn contagion was enhanced in pregnant women, a cohort of subjects who develop prenatal emotional attachment in preparation for parental care, via hormonal and neurobiological changes. We predicted that if yawn contagion underlies social and emotional attachment, pregnant women would be more likely to contagiously yawn than nonpregnant, nulliparous women of reproductive age. We gathered data in two different settings. In the experimental setting, 49 women were exposed to video stimuli of newborns either yawning or moving their mouth (control) and we video-recorded the women during repeated trials to measure their yawning response. In the naturalistic setting, 131 women were observed in a social environment and their yawning response was recorded. We tested the factors influencing the yawning response, including the reproductive status (pregnant vs. not pregnant). In both settings, yawn contagion occurred significantly more in pregnant than nonpregnant women. By showing that pregnant women were most likely to respond to others' yawns, our results support the hypothesis that the social variation observed in yawn contagion may be influenced by emotional attachment and that yawning in highly social species might have been coopted for emotional contagion during evolution.\n",
      "Yawning is a clinical sign of the activity of various supra- and infratentorial brain regions including the putative brainstem motor pattern, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, probably the insula and limbic structures that are interconnected via a fiber network. This interaction can be seen in analogy to other cerebral functions arising from a network or zone such as language. Within this network, yawning fulfills its function in a stereotype, reflex-like manner; a phylogenetically old function, preserved across species barriers, with the purpose of arousal, communication, and maybe other functions including respiration. Abnormal yawning with ≥3 yawns/15min without obvious cause arises from lesions of brain areas involved in the yawning zone, its trajectories causing a disconnection syndrome, or from alteration of network activity by physical or metabolic etiologies including medication.\n",
      "Yawning is a multifunctional behavior with a role in social communication. In Old World monkeys, the \"tension yawn\" is often used as a threat, allowing individuals to completely expose their canines. To explore the role of this phenomenon, we selected 2 closely related species-Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and Tonkean macaques (M. tonkeana)-which differ primarily in terms of their tolerance levels. Japanese macaques are classified as despotic; Tonkean macaques are classified as tolerant. Both species live in multimale-multifemale societies, show a high level of sexual dimorphism, and have comparable yawning repertoires that include displaying a covered teeth yawn and an uncovered gums yawn. We found comparable baseline frequencies of the 2 yawning types and a similar distribution of these behaviors according to sex (males yawned more frequently than females). This morphological homogeneity permitted us to evaluate potential differences in the meaning of yawning as a function of social tension, aggressive contexts, and dominance hierarchy. Divergent social styles determine a functional dichotomy in the use of the covered teeth yawn and the uncovered gums yawn. The covered teeth yawn is not susceptible to social and environmental stimuli and seems to be a form of yawning mostly linked to the physiology of the sleep-wake cycle. However, the uncovered gums yawn is modulated according to different social contexts, and its use could be favored by natural selection, especially in tolerant species, which apparently require more elaborate forms of social communication.

      "Yawning often occurs during states of increased sleep propensity. Depression is associated with sleep problems and tiredness. The aim of this paper is to review the present knowledge about possible changes of yawning during an episode of major depression (MD) and to report data on yawning from an online depression forum comprising of 450,000 postings. A literature search did not reveal any study about yawning in people with MD when compared to controls. However, there is evidence for an increased frequency of yawning under the influence of antidepressants. Analysis of the depression forum postings revealed 63 people writing about increased yawning in the context of depression. However, all but one of them were treated with antidepressants; and yawning was not reported as a symptom of depression, but in most cases (N=56) as occurring as a result of treatment with antidepressants. These findings are in agreement with a tonic hyperarousal in typical depression which is reduced by all standard antidepressants. For clinicians, it would be of interest to know whether yawning is reduced in untreated depression and whether it predicts treatment outcome.\n",
      "The phenomenon of yawning is just as intriguing and fascinating as sleep, yet understanding of its causes and consequences has defied the human mind for centuries. Hippocrates, Sennert, Boerhaave and de Gorter each advanced a theory in his time. From the release of tainted humor to the awakening of animal spirits and improved brain oxygenation, the metaphors that developed from these theories are all characterized by their popular success, which endured until the time of J.M. Charcot and even into our own day. However, starting in the early 19th century, a neuromuscular theory developed from the experimental physiology of Broussais and Flourens, which Dumpert (working in Germany after World War I) explained in detail. Experimental ethology and pharmacology in the 20th century brought the neuromediators and subcortical structures involved in yawning and pandiculation to light. Phylogenetically and ontogenetically primitive, these motor behaviors have been remarkably well preserved during evolution and are nearly universal in vertebrates. They are closer to an emotional stereotypy than to a reflex. Originating in the diencephalon, they appear to exteriorize homeostatic processes in the systems controlling arousal, hunger and sexuality.\n",
      "The authors tested susceptibility to contagious itching, laughter, and yawning in 55 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ages 8-14, and 106 typically developing (TD) children, ages 5-14. Children with ASD were less likely to yawn or laugh contagiously compared with TD peers, but showed increased susceptibility to contagious itching, under naturalistic conditions. Contagious yawning and laughter were positively correlated with emotional empathy in the TD group. In contrast, contagious itching showed no relationship to empathy, and was positively correlated with autism symptom severity in the ASD group. The authors explore the implications of these findings in terms of psychological theories about ASD.\n",
      "Yawning is a phylogenetically old, stereotyped event that occurs alone or associated with stretching and/or penile erection in humans and in animals from reptiles to birds and mammals under different conditions. Although its physiological function is still unknown, yawning is under the control of several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides at the central level as this short overview of the literature on the neurochemistry of yawning shows. Among these substances, the best known are dopamine, excitatory amino acids, acetylcholine, serotonin, nitric oxide, adrenocorticotropic hormone-related peptides and oxytocin, that facilitate yawning and opioid peptides that inhibit this behavioral response. Some of the above compounds interact in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to control yawning. This hypothalamic nucleus contains the cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas that play a key role in the expression of this behavioral event. When activated by dopamine, excitatory amino acids and oxytocin itself, these neurons facilitate yawning by releasing oxytocin at sites distant form the paraventricular nucleus, i.e. the hippocampus, the pons and/or the medulla oblongata. Conversely, activation of these neurons by dopamine, oxytocin or excitatory amino acids, is antagonized by opioid peptides, that, in turn, prevent the yawning response. The activation and inhibition, respectively of these oxytocinergic neurons is related to a concomitant increase and decrease, respectively, of paraventricular nitric oxide synthase activity. However, other neuronal systems in addition to the central paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons are involved in the control of yawning, since they do not seem to be involved in the expression of yawning induced by the stimulation of acetylcholine or serotoninergic receptors, nor by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and related peptides. Nitric oxide is also involved in the induction of yawning by the latter compounds and neuronal links, for instance between dopamine and acetylcholine and dopamine and serotonin, seem to be involved in the yawning response. Finally, other neurotransmitters, i.e. gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and noradrenaline, and neuropeptides, i.e. neurotensin and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), influence this behavioral response. In conclusion, in spite of some recent progress, little is known of, and more has to be done to identify, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying yawning at the central level.\n",
      "Primate yawns are usually categorized according to context (e.g. as a threat, anxious, or rest yawn), but there has been little consideration of whether these yawns are best regarded as a unitary behavior that only differs with respect to the context in which it is observed. This study examined the context and precise morphology of yawns in a group of 11 captive chimpanzees. Focal video sampling was used to describe the morphology and intensity of 124 yawns using ChimpFACS, a system for coding facial movements. Two distinct forms of yawn were identified, a full yawn and a yawn which is modified by additional actions that reduce the mouth aperture. These modified yawns may indicate some degree of voluntary control over facial movement in chimpanzees and, consequently, multiple functions of yawning according to context. To assess context effects, mean activity levels (resting, locomotion, and grooming) and scratching rates were compared one minute before and after each yawn. Locomotion was significantly increased following both types of yawn, whereas scratching rates significantly increased following modified yawns but decreased following full yawns. In terms of individual differences, males did not yawn more than females, although male yawns were of higher intensity, both in the degree of mouth opening and in the amount of associated head movement. These data indicate that yawning is associated with a change in activity levels in chimpanzees, but only modified yawns may be related to increased arousal. Different types of yawn can therefore be differentiated at the morphological level as well as context level.\n",

      "The existence of yawning across a diverse array of species has led many researchers to postulate its neurological significance. One hypothesis, which has garnered recent support, posits that yawns function to cool the brain by flushing hyperthermic blood away from the skull while simultaneously introducing a cooler arterial supply. The current study tested this hypothesis by examining how manipulations aimed at modifying carotid artery temperature, which in turn directly alters cranial temperature, influences contagious yawning in humans. Participants held either a warm (46 °C), cold (4 °C) or room temperature (22 °C) pack firmly to their neck, just over their carotid arteries, for a period of five minutes prior to watching a contagious yawning stimulus. Thermographic imaging verified that these manipulations produced predicted changes in temperature at the superomedial orbital area, a region previously used as a noninvasive measure of brain temperature (i.e., the brain temperature tunnel). As predicted by past research, both the urge to yawn and overall yawn frequency significantly diminished in the cooling condition (p < .05). Less than half (48.5%) of the participants in the cooling condition reported the urge to yawn, while this urge was expressed by the vast majority of participants in the warming condition (84.8%). Moreover, there was a threefold difference in the mean number of yawns per participant between the cooling and warming conditions (0.364 compared to 1.121). These findings are consistent with previous research indicating that yawns function as a compensatory brain cooling mechanism.\n"

      "Here we show for the first time that the plasticity in morphology and duration of yawning in Macaca tonkeana can be associated with different functional contexts. Macaca tonkeana is classified as a tolerant macaque species characterized by social interactions minimally constrained by dominance rank or kinship. Tonkean macaques, as other egalitarian species, rely on a complex facial communicative system. We found that the degree of mouth opening (ranging from covered to uncovered tooth yawns) and the duration of yawning were not strictly dependent. The shortest uncovered tooth yawns were associated with an intense locomotor/physical activity and peaked immediately after stressful social events thus indicating an increase in arousal. In contrast, longer yawns, independently from teeth exposure, were primarily associated with a relaxed state of the subject. In conclusion, our study suggests that to explore the potential different functions of yawning, it is necessary to focus on the variability of its expression both in terms of morphology and duration, because not all yawns tell the same story.\n",

      "The existence of yawning across vertebrate species suggests important basic functions, and the spontaneous and involuntary nature of a yawn lends support for it having adaptive significance. Recent research suggests the biological function of yawning among homeotherms is central thermoregulation. Comparative research from birds, rats and humans shows that yawning reduces brain and body temperature, is influenced by the range and direction of ambient temperature change, and is inhibited by methods of behavioral cooling. This research provides strong support for the view that yawning stimulates or facilitates cortical arousal, demonstrating that a yawn is a behavioral response to transient brain hyperthermia, acting to counter intermittent increases in brain temperature and promote thermal homeostasis. This theory is powerful because it not only integrates a great deal of seemingly diverse information about yawning, but it can also be used to generate numerous testable predictions. Applications from this research range from basic physiological understanding to the improved treatment and understanding of diseases associated with thermoregulatory dysfunction.\n",

      "Spontaneous mimicry appears fundamental to emotional perception and contagion, especially when it involves facial emotional expressions. Here we cover recent evidence on spontaneous mimicry from ethology, psychology and neuroscience, in non-human and human animals. We first consider how mimicry unfolds in non-human animals (particularly primates) and how it relates to emotional contagion. We focus on two forms of mimicry-related phenomena: facial mimicry and yawn contagion, which are largely conserved across mammals and useful to draw evolutionary scenarios. Next, we expand on the psychological evidence from humans that bears on current theoretical debates and also informs non-human animal research. Finally, we cover the neural bases of facial mimicry and yawn contagion. We move beyond the perception/expression/experience trichotomy and from the correlational to the causal evidence that links facial mimicry to emotional contagion by presenting evidence from neuroimaging, direct manipulation, neuro-stimulation and lesion studies. In conclusion, this review proposes a bottom-up, multidisciplinary approach to the study of spontaneous mimicry that accounts for the evolutionary continuity linking non-human and human animals.\n",
      "Contagious yawning (i.e. yawning triggered by perceiving others' yawning) is a well-documented phenomenon, but the mechanism underlying it is still unclear. In this chapter, I review the current evidence about: (1) developmental studies with typically and atypically developing populations, and (2) comparative studies in non-human animals. Developmental studies have revealed that contagious yawning is disturbed in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that contagious yawning may share a developmental basis with the capacity for theory of mind. Comparative studies have suggested that contagious yawning can be observed in non-primate species, such as domestic dogs. As dogs are known to have exceptional skills in communicating with humans, it has also been suggested that contagious yawning may be related to the capacity for social communication. These results from developmental and comparative studies are consistent with the claim that the mechanism underlying contagious yawning relates to the capacity for empathy.\n",

      "Data synthesis: Yawning is a common stereotype behavior with unknown physiologic function that occurs in most vertebrates and humans as early as 15 weeks of intrauterine life. Yawning is under the control of several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, including dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and acetylcholine. Among drugs, antidepressants, opioids, dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, and induction agents are the main pharmacologic classes associated with yawning.\n",

      "Yawning is a behavior that begins in the first stages of life. It has not only been observed in infants and in newborns, but also in fetuses of 12-14 weeks' gestational age. Yawning frequency changes over the life span. In preterm infants, the number of yawns decreases between 31 and 40 weeks' postconceptional age, mainly during the day. In this period of life, yawning is an isolated behavior rarely occurring in bursts, and its frequency is quite low with respect to adults. The incidence of yawning seems to increase when children attend elementary school, whereas this is reduced in the elderly. Aged people yawn less than younger ones, mainly during morning and mid-afternoon. In adults, the time course of yawning is associated with the time course of sleepiness, except upon awakening when the high frequency of yawns is not associated with high sleepiness. In adults, yawning frequency increases in the early morning and in the late evening, whereas at the earliest stages of development (fetuses and preterm infants) yawning does not show diurnal variations. Yawning seems to be involved in the modulation of arousal process across the whole life span. In preterm infants, yawning is often followed by motor activation and it is more common during waking than sleep; in adults, yawning occurs mainly at sleep onset and upon awakening.\n"

      "Yawning is a common behavioral event that is observed in humans, as well as other mammals, birds and reptiles. In humans, yawning often occurs just before bed and upon waking up, and is also associated with tedious or boring situations. Although the physiologic roles of yawning have yet to be fully elucidated, the past 50 years of research has led to a much greater understanding of the neuropharmacologic regulation of yawning. While many of the early studies concluded that yawning was primarily driven by changes in cholinergic neurotransmission, we now know that numerous neurotransmitters and neurohormones are involved in the mediation of yawning, including acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, oxytocin, GABA, opioids, adrenergics, nitric oxide, as well as the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides ACTH and alpha-MSH. Furthermore, antagonist interaction studies have clearly defined at least 3 distinct neural pathways involved in the induction of yawning, as well as the hierarchical order through which these different neurotransmitter systems interact to regulate yawning. The following sections will discuss the state of knowledge for each of the major neurotransmitters and neurohormones involved in the regulation of yawning, their interactions with one another, and their place in the hierarchical organization of yawning.\n",
      "Yawning is one of the most under-appreciated behaviors. It is a stereotyped and often repetitive motor act, characterized by gaping of the mouth accompanied by a long inspiration, a brief acme followed by a short expiration. The vigor of the act may increase arousal. Although socially offensive to many, yawns often bring pleasure to the yawner. While influenced by several neurotransmitters, yawning is strongly affected by dopamine. Dopamine activates oxytocin production in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, oxytocin may then activate cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and the reticular formation of the brainstem. Acethylcholine induces yawning via the muscarinic receptors of effectors. Other neurotransmitters can modulate its occurence like serotonin, neuropeptides, hypocretin and sexual hormones. The decrease of yawning in the elderly suggests an associated decrease of dopaminergic activity. Yawning and stretching have related phylogenetic old origins. Ethologists agree that most vertebrates yawn. Yawning is morphologically similar in reptiles, birds, mammals and fishes. They may be ancestral vestiges surviving throughout evolution with little variation. In the human embryo, yawning occurs as early as 12 weeks after conception and remains relatively unchanged throughout life. Across the life span, night sleep undergoes several age-related modifications. Theses changes concern sleep duration and the amount of REM and NREM sleep. We can describe, for the duration of REM sleep, a curvilinear trend with a steep descending slope in the last time of fetus life and the first year of life, a plateau level across childhood and adulthood, slowly lowering until age. A parallel curve demonstrates the similarity of the evolution of yawn's frequency and the amount of REM sleep. Thus, from ontogeny, phylogeny and this modelling approach emerges a pivotal link between yawning and REM sleep. Yawning is modified in some pathologies associated with aging.\n",

The proposed scheme is equipped with a tracking divergence estimate, which allows to detect early and minimize the face tracking errors, so the tracked face is not missed indefinitely. When the estimated face tracking error increases, a resyncing mechanism based on Constrained Local Models (CLM) is activated to reduce the tracking errors by re-estimating the tracked facial features' locations (e.g., facial landmarks). To improve the Constrained Local Model (CLM) feature search mechanism, a Weighted-CLM (W-CLM) is proposed and used in resyncing. The performance of the proposed face tracking method is evaluated in the challenging context of driver monitoring using yawning detection and talking video datasets. Furthermore, an improvement in a yawning detection scheme is proposed. Experiments suggest that our proposed face tracking scheme can obtain a better performance than comparable state-of-the-art face tracking methods and can be successfully applied in yawning detection.\n",

      "Yawning is a physiological event that can be divided into three distinct phases: a long inspiratory phase, a brief acme and a rapid exspiration. The reason for yawning is not yet well defined. However this semi-voluntary event increases vigilance and aims to alert when drowsiness occurs. Yawning may have an important role for social communication. The neuropharmacology of yawning is complex and knowledge of its mechanisms is incomplete. While under the control of several neurotransmitters, yawning is largely affected by dopamine. Dopamine may activate oxytocin production in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, oxytocin may then activate cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, and finally acetylcholine might induce yawning via the muscarinic receptors of the effectors. In fact, this scheme is simplified. Many other molecules can modulate yawning, such as nitric oxide, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, ACTH, MSH, sexual hormones and opium derivate peptides.\n",
      "Despite the fact that yawning is a reality of everyday life, its study is not included in the curriculum of medical schools, and most medical textbooks barely mention its existence. Two factors may help to explain this puzzling situation: (a) yawning's borderline position between psychology and neurology, and (b) researchers' lack of understanding as to why people yawn. After review of the literature and personal observation, it is concluded that yawning is a complex arousal defense reflex located in the reticular brainstem with a peripheral and central arche, whose aim is to reverse brain hypoxia. Yawning occurs with loss of interest (boredom) and may or may not be associated with fatigue. By reversing drowsiness, yawning avoids a decreased concentration capacity resulting from borderline hypoxia. It is hoped that this article will stimulate further research on the phenomenon.\n",
      "Contagious yawning is triggered by others yawning, and it has previously been reported in humans, primates and several experimental and companion mammals. Whereas it might be a response to an innate releasing mechanism, contagious yawning is also considered to involve emotional contagion. Here, we demonstrate that sheep, the animal model of livestock animals, also experience contagious yawning. Twelve adult castrated Corriedale sheep were used in this study. Pairs of sheep were adjacently restrained with or without a wooden divider panel to shield them from viewing the other. Their behaviors were video-recorded for 3 days in each condition. Sheep yawned 2.0 ± 1.1 and 1.2 ± 1.1 times/day/head in the unshielded and shielded conditions, respectively. Unshielded restrained sheep yawned within 1 min after the other one 11.1% of the time, while shielded pairs did not exhibit contagious yawning. Rumination was also highly synchronized under the unshielded condition. These data reveal that contagious yawning and behavioral synchronicity occur in ruminants like sheep, making them a suitable animal model to investigate contagious yawning and the underlying mechanism.\n",
      "In humans, the susceptibility to yawn contagion has been theoretically and empirically related to our capacity for empathy. Because of its relevance to evolutionary biology, this phenomenon has been the focus of recent investigations in non-human species. In line with the empathic hypothesis, contagious yawning has been shown to correlate with the level of social attachment in several primate species. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have also shown the ability to yawn contagiously. To date, however, the social modulation of dog contagious yawning has received contradictory support and alternative explanations (i.e., yawn as a mild distress response) could explain positive evidence. The present study aims to replicate contagious yawning in dogs and to discriminate between the two possible mediating mechanisms (i.e., empathic vs. distress related response). Twenty-five dogs observed familiar (dog's owner) and unfamiliar human models (experimenter) acting out a yawn or control mouth movements. Concurrent physiological measures (heart rate) were additionally monitored for twenty-one of the subjects. The occurrence of yawn contagion was significantly higher during the yawning condition than during the control mouth movements. Furthermore, the dogs yawned more frequently when watching the familiar model than the unfamiliar one demonstrating that the contagiousness of yawning in dogs correlated with the level of emotional proximity. Moreover, subjects' heart rate did not differ among conditions suggesting that the phenomenon of contagious yawning in dogs is unrelated to stressful events. Our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning is modulated by affective components of the behavior and may indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in domesticated dogs.\n"

      "Background: Yawning is a phylogenetically old behavior of ubiquitous occurrence. The origin and function of this conspicuous phenomenon have been subject to speculation for centuries. A widely held hypothesis posits that yawning increases the arousal level during sleepiness; thus, providing a homeostatic regulation of vigilance.\n",
      "Methods: This chapter reviews experimental data on the relationship between yawning and vigilance that allow testing of the components and predictions of this hypothesis.\n",
      "Results: Behavioral studies and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity before and after yawning have provided consistent evidence that yawning occurs during states of low vigilance; thus, substantiating the notion that it is provoked by sleepiness. However, studies analyzing autonomic nervous activity and EEG-based indices of vigilance in yawning subjects did not find specific autonomic activations or increased arousal levels after yawning.\n",
      "Conclusions: The data therefore do not support an arousing effect of yawning or a role in regulation of vigilance or autonomic tone.\n",
      "Background: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from the repetitive yawning and sleep problems. Yawning is observed in MS and other central nervous system disorders and yawning and swallowing may be controlled by the network of the brain stem. Therefore it is important to investigate the MS patients with various clinical and radiological locations in order to understand the role of brainstem on the yawning mechanisms. One hour polygraphic recording would be crucial method for this purpose, because it is easy to observe spontaneous yawning (SY) and spontaneous swallowing (SS) together with their electrophysiologic counterparts. Previous studies reported that contagious yawn and swallow are temporally related and frequency of swallows was increased within 10s of post yawn period in normal adult subjects. We have re-investigated this phenomenon by studying the SY and SS in polygraphic recording in normal subjects and patients with MS. Then we hypothesized that SY is expected to be increased in MS patients.\n",
      "Methods: 49 patients with MS and 19 control subjects were recruited in this study. We used a twelve-channel electroencephalography (EEG) device. Five channels were for electromyography (EMG) recording. We also used one channel for laryngeal sensor for vertical movements of the larynx during swallowing. Cardiac rhythm, respiration and sympathetic skin responses were synchronously recorded during swallowing. We evaluated rate of total SY, swallows inside the yawning, before and after 10s of the yawning and yawning unrelated with swallowing.\n",
      "Results: Patients with MS yawned more frequently than healthy controls (p = 0,044). It was obvious that the yawning unrelated with spontaneous swallow was also significantly increased compared to normal controls (p = 0,047), whereas swallowing inside the yawn or before and after 10s of yawning were not significantly different in both groups. Among 49 MS patients, 16 (32.6%) had brainstem involvement. Yawning was observed in only 6 (37.5%) of them.\n",
      "Conclusion: Yawning is significantly increased in MS patients compared to normal controls by using the polygraphic method. There is no direct relation of the brainstem and the origin of yawning in MS patients according to clinical picture and MRI findings. However safe swallows during yawning could suggest that there is still need to some brain stem mechanism and/or oropharyngeal reflexes. Difficulties must be emphasized to detect anatomic localization in MS because of relapsing pattern of disease.\n",
      "Communication is an essential aspect of animal social life. Animals may influence one another and come together in schools, flocks, and herds. Communication is also the way sexes interact during courtship and how rivals settle disputes without fighting. However, there are some behavioral patterns for which it is difficult to test the existence of a communicatory function, because several types of sensory modalities are likely involved. For example, contagious yawning is a communicatory act in mammals that potentially occurs through sight, hearing, smell, or a combination of these senses depending on whether the animals are familiar to one another. Therefore, to test hypotheses about the possible communicatory role of such behaviors, a suitable method is necessary to identify the participating sensory modalities. The method proposed here aims to obtain yawn contagion curves for familiar and unfamiliar rats and evaluate the relative participation of visual and olfactory sensory modalities. The method uses inexpensive materials, and with some minor changes, it can also be used with other rodent species such as mice. Overall, the method involves the substitution of clear dividers (with or without holes) with opaque dividers (with or without holes) that either allow or prevent communication between rats placed in adjacent cages with holes in adjoining sides. Accordingly, four conditions can be tested: olfactory communication, visual communication, both visual and olfactory communication, and neither visual nor olfactory communication. As social interaction occurs between the rats, these test conditions simulate what may occur in a natural environment. In this respect, the method proposed here is more effective than traditional methods that rely on video presentations whose biological validity can raise concerns. Nonetheless, it does not discriminate between the potential role of hearing and roles of smell and vision in yawn contagion.\n",
      "Yawning is a behavior to which little research has been devoted. However, its purpose has not yet been demonstrated and remains controversial. In this article, we propose a new theory involving the brain network that is functional during the resting state, that is, the default mode network. When this network is active, yawning manifests a process of switching to the attentional system through its capacity to increase circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), thereby increasing clearance of somnogenic factors (prostaglandin D(2), adenosine, and others) accumulating in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n",

      "Modern humans live in an \"exploded\" network with unusually large circles of trust that form due to prosociality toward unfamiliar people (i.e. xenophilia). In a set of experiments we demonstrate that semi-free ranging bonobos (Pan paniscus) - both juveniles and young adults - also show spontaneous responses consistent with xenophilia. Bonobos voluntarily aided an unfamiliar, non-group member in obtaining food even when he/she did not make overt requests for help. Bonobos also showed evidence for involuntary, contagious yawning in response to videos of yawning conspecifics who were complete strangers. These experiments reveal that xenophilia in bonobos can be unselfish, proactive and automatic. They support the first impression hypothesis that suggests xenophilia can evolve through individual selection in social species whenever the benefits of building new bonds outweigh the costs. Xenophilia likely evolved in bonobos as the risk of intergroup aggression dissipated and the benefits of bonding between immigrating members increased. Our findings also mean the human potential for xenophilia is either evolutionarily shared or convergent with bonobos and not unique to our species as previously proposed.\n",

      "Studies of contagious yawning have reported inconsistent findings regarding whether dogs exhibit this behavior and whether it is mediated by social-cognitive processes or the result of physiological arousal. We investigated why some dogs yawn in response to human yawns; particularly, whether these dogs are exceptional in their ability to understand human social cues or whether they were more physiologically aroused. Sixty shelter dogs were exposed to yawning and nonyawning control stimuli demonstrated by an unfamiliar human. We took salivary cortisol samples before and after testing to determine the role of arousal in yawn contagion. Dogs were tested on the object-choice task to assess their sensitivity for interpreting human social cues. We found that 12 dogs yawned only in response to human yawns (i.e., appeared to exhibit yawn contagion), though contagious yawning at the population level was not observed. Dogs that exhibited yawn contagion did not perform better on the object-choice task than other dogs, but their cortisol levels remained elevated after exposure to human yawning, whereas other dogs had reduced cortisol levels following yawning stimuli relative to their baseline levels. We interpret these findings as showing that human yawning, when presented in a stressful context, can further influence arousal in dogs, which then causes some to yawn. Although the precise social-cognitive mechanisms that underlie contagious yawning in dogs are still unclear, yawning between humans and dogs may involve some communicative function that is modulated by context and arousal.\n"

      "Humans express facial mimicry across a variety of actions. This article explores a distinct example, contagious yawning, and the links to empathy and prosocial behavior. Prior studies have suggested that there is a positive link between empathy and the susceptibility to contagious yawning. However, the existing evidence has been sparse and contradictory. We present results from 2 laboratory studies conducted with 171 (Study 1) and 333 (Study 2) student volunteers. Subjects were video-recorded while watching muted videos of individuals yawning, scratching, or laughing. Empathy was measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Although subjects imitated all facial expressions to large extents, our studies show that only contagious yawning was related to empathy. Subjects who yawned in response to observing others yawn exhibited higher empathy values by half a standard deviation. However, we found no evidence that the susceptibility to contagious yawning is directly related to prosocial behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).\n",
      "On the basis of observational and experimental evidence, several authors have proposed that contagious yawn is linked to our capacity for empathy, thus presenting a powerful tool to explore the root of empathy in animal evolution. The evidence for the occurrence of contagious yawning and its link to empathy, however, is meagre outside primates and only recently domestic dogs have demonstrated this ability when exposed to human yawns. Since dogs are unusually skillful at reading human communicative behaviors, it is unclear whether this phenomenon is deeply rooted in the evolutionary history of mammals or evolved de novo in dogs as a result of domestication. Here we show that wolves are capable of yawn contagion, suggesting that such ability is a common ancestral trait shared by other mammalian taxa. Furthermore, the strength of the social bond between the model and the subject positively affected the frequency of contagious yawning, suggesting that in wolves the susceptibility of yawn contagion correlates with the level of emotional proximity. Moreover, female wolves showed a shorter reaction time than males when observing yawns of close associates, suggesting that females are more responsive to their social stimuli. These results are consistent with the claim that the mechanism underlying contagious yawning relates to the capacity for empathy and suggests that basic building blocks of empathy might be present in a wide range of species.\n",

      "Although few things are as common as yawning, it has traditionally held little interest for researchers and enquiring minds of all disciplines. Yawning is a recognized behavior in almost all vertebrates, present throughout life, which often procures a sense of well-being for the yawner. Modern science is still searching for a complete explanation of the mechanisms and purpose of yawning, with debate about its usefulness as a stimulatory mechanism still ongoing. In this paper, we offer an overview of the popular beliefs and myths seen within Arabic, Western and Indian cultures.\n",

      "This study is the first to demonstrate that human yawns are possibly contagious to domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Twenty-nine dogs observed a human yawning or making control mouth movements. Twenty-one dogs yawned when they observed a human yawning, but control mouth movements did not elicit yawning from any of them. The presence of contagious yawning in dogs suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to primate species and may indicate that dogs possess the capacity for a rudimentary form of empathy. Since yawning is known to modulate the levels of arousal, yawn contagion may help coordinate dog-human interaction and communication. Understanding the mechanism as well as the function of contagious yawning between humans and dogs requires more detailed investigation.\n",

      "Contagious yawning, the onset of a yawn triggered by seeing, hearing, reading, or thinking about another person yawn is a well-documented phenomenon. The mechanisms that drive contagious yawning are as yet unknown, but there is recent evidence of a link between contagious yawning and self-processing (S.M. Platek, S.R. Critton, T.E. Myers, G.G. Gallup Jr., Contagious yawning: the role of self-awareness and mental state attribution, Cogn. Brain Res. 17 (2003) 223-227.) that is negatively impacted by schizotypal personality traits. The neural substrates involved in contagious yawning, however, are unknown. Here, using fMRI, we show that viewing someone yawn evokes unique neural activity in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. Because of the role these areas play in self-processing (e.g., self-referential processing, theory of mind, autobiographical memory), our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that contagious yawning may be part of a neural network involved in empathy.\n",
      "The relationship between right to left shunt (RLS) and non-headache symptoms (NHS) in episodic migraine is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and classification of RLS in episodic migraineurs, calculate the occurrence rate of NHS, and analyze the associations between RLS and NHS. We consecutively recruited 204 episodic migraine patients. Contrast-enhanced transcranial doppler was adopted to screen RLS. Structured questionnaire via face-to-face survey was conducted to collect clinical data. A total of 172 episodic migraineurs were included in the final analysis, of which 20 cases were migraine with aura. The positive rate of RLS was 47.1%, of which 50 cases (29.0%) had small shunt (Grade 1) and 31 cases (18.1%) had mid-large shunt (Grade 2-4). The most common NHS was nausea (115 (66.9%)), followed by headache aggravation with physical activity (96 (55.8%)), dizziness (93 (54.1%)), vomiting (77 (44.8%)) and phonophobia (74 (43.0%)). Yawning was more common in Grade 2-4 group than Grade 0 group (p = 0.012), while no statistical differences among other groups. Grade 2-4 group had a higher rate of headache aggravation with physical activity than grade 0 group (p = 0.008). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that yawning at premonitory phase, headache aggravation with physical activity and cranial autonomic symptoms during attack are independent predictors of RLS. In conclusion, yawning and headache aggravation with physical activity are more common in migraine patients with RLS. Besides aura, particular NHS may also serve as indicators for screening RLS in episodic migraineurs.\n",
      "Among some haplorhine primates, including humans, relaxed yawns spread contagiously. Such contagious yawning has been linked to social bonds and empathy in some species. However, no studies have investigated contagious yawning in strepsirhines. We conducted an experimental study of contagious yawning in strepsirhines, testing ring-tailed and ruffed lemurs (n = 24) in a paradigm similar to one that has induced contagious yawning in haplorhines. First, in a control experiment, we investigated whether lemurs responded to projected video content in general (experiment 1). We showed them two videos to which we expected differential responses: one featured a terrestrial predator and the other a caretaker holding food. Next, to test for yawn contagion, we showed individual lemurs life-size video projections of groupmates and conspecific strangers yawning, and control footage of the same individuals at rest (experiment 2). Then, to examine whether a group context might enhance or allow for contagion, we exposed subjects to the same videos in a group setting (experiment 3). Lemurs produced alarm vocalizations and moved upward while viewing the predator, but not the caretaker, demonstrating that they do perceive video content meaningfully. However, lemurs did not yawn in response to yawning stimuli when tested alone, or with their groupmates. This study provides preliminary evidence that lemurs do not respond to yawning stimuli similarly to haplorhines, and suggests that this behavior may have evolved or become more exaggerated in haplorhines after the two major primate lineages split.\n"

      "The neural mechanisms responsible for spontaneous yawning as well as contagious yawning are not well characterized. Neuroimaging is an essential tool for helping to identify the seminal neural structures and their inter-related functions to carry out this complex stereotyped motor program. Studies to date have explored the structural neural correlates of yawning through a series of lesion-based case reports and identified participatory structures at various levels of the central nervous system. Functional neuroimaging methods like fMRI have also shed led on the genesis of contagious yawning, though cohesive models explaining the neural mechanisms of contagious motor programs such as yawning remain limited.\n",
      "Yawning is a phylogenetically old, stereotyped event that occurs alone or associated with stretching and/or penile erection in humans, in animals from reptiles to birds and mammals, under different conditions. Several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are involved in its control at the central level. One of these at the level of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVHN) is nitric oxide (NO). First, NO synthase inhibitors injected into this hypothalamic nucleus prevent yawning induced by dopamine agonists, oxytocin or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), which induce yawning by activating PVHN oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas. The inhibitory effect of NO synthase inhibitors was not observed when these compounds were given concomitantly with L-arginine, the precursor of NO. Second, dopamine agonists, NMDA and oxytocin given at doses that induce yawning, increase NO production in the PVHN, as determined by in vivo microdialysis. Conversely, the opiate morphine, which prevents yawning induced by dopamine agonists, oxytocin and NMDA, also prevents the increase in the paraventricular NO production induced by these compounds. Third, NO donors, such as nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside and hydroxylamine, induce yawning when injected into the PVHN apparently by activating oxytocinergic transmission. Since guanylate cyclase inhibitors and NO scavengers (hemoglobin) injected into the PVHN do not prevent drug-induced yawning, nor 8-Br-cGMP injected into the PVHN induces this behavioral response, it is likely that NO acts as an intracellular rather than an intercellular modulator inside the PVHN oxytocinergic neurons in which NO is formed to facilitate the expression of this phylogenetically old event by guanylate cyclase-independent mechanisms.\n",
      "Contagious yawning may be a useful measure of social psychological functioning, and thus it is important to evaluate the variables influencing its expression in laboratory settings. Previous research has documented that humans yawn less frequently in crowded environments and when under direct observation, but the impact of social presence on contagious yawning remains unknown. Here we present the first study to systematically alter the degree of social presence experienced by participants in the laboratory to determine its effect on contagious yawning frequency. Our results demonstrate that both implied and actual social presence significantly diminish yawn contagion in comparison to a control condition, indicating a key social component to contagious yawning. These findings provide a framework for pursuing additional research investigating the social factors influencing contagious yawning, while also offering applications for measuring this response in laboratory settings.\n",
      "Six adult female chimpanzees were shown video scenes of chimpanzees repeatedly yawning or of chimpanzees showing open-mouth facial expressions that were not yawns. Two out of the six females showed significantly higher frequencies of yawning in response to yawn videos; no chimpanzees showed the inverse. Three infant chimpanzees that accompanied their mothers did not yawn at all. These data are highly reminiscent of the contagious yawning effects reported for humans. Contagious yawning is thought to be based on the capacity for empathy. Contagious yawning in chimpanzees provides further evidence that these apes may possess advanced self-awareness and empathic abilities.\n",

      "Contagious yawning is a well-documented phenomenon in humans and has recently attracted much attention from developmental and comparative sciences. The function, development and underlying mechanisms of the phenomenon, however, remain largely unclear. Contagious yawning has been demonstrated in dogs and several non-human primate species, and theoretically and empirically associated with empathy in humans and non-human primates. Evidence of emotional closeness modulating contagious yawning in dogs has, nonetheless, been contradictory. Humans show a developmental increase in susceptibility to yawn contagion, with typically developing children displaying a substantial increase at the age of four, when a number of cognitive abilities (e.g. accurate identification of others' emotions) begin to clearly manifest. Explicit tests of yawn contagion in non-human animals have, however, thus far only involved adult individuals. Here, we report a study of the ontogeny of domestic dogs' (Canis lupus familiaris) susceptibility to yawn contagion, and whether emotional closeness to the yawning model affects this. Thirty-five dogs, aged 4-14 months, observed a familiar and unfamiliar human repeatedly yawn or gape. The dogs yawned contagiously, but emotional closeness with the model did not affect the strength of contagion, raising questions as to recent evidence of emotionally modulated auditory contagious yawning in dogs. The dogs showed a developmental effect, with only dogs above 7 months evidencing contagion. The results support the notion of a developmental increase in dogs' attention to others and identification of others' emotional states and suggest that yawn contagion is underpinned by developmental processes shared by humans and other animals.\n",

      "Yawning is a stereotypical behavior pattern commonly associated with other behaviors such as grooming, sleepiness, and arousal. Several differences in behavioral and neurochemical characteristics have been described in high-yawning (HY) and low-yawning (LY) sublines from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that support they had changes in the neural mechanism between sublines. Differences in behavior and neurochemistry observed in yawning sublines could also overlap in processes needed during taste learning, particularly during conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and its latent inhibition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze taste memory differences, after familiarization to novel or highly sweet stimuli, between yawning sublines and compare them with outbred SD rats. First, we evaluated changes in appetitive response during long-term sugar consumption for 14 days. Then, we evaluated the latent inhibition of CTA strength induced by this long pre-exposure, and we also measured aversive memory extinction rate. The results showed that SD rats and the two sublines developed similar CTA for novel sugar and significantly stronger appetitive memory after long-term sugar exposure. However, after 14 days of sugar exposure, HY and LY sublines were unable to develop latent inhibition of CTA after two acquisition trials and had a slower aversive memory extinction rate than outbreed rats. Thus, the inability of the HY and LY sublines to develop latent inhibition of CTA after long-term sugar exposure could be related to the time/context processes involved in long-term appetitive re-learning, and in the strong inbreeding that characterizes the behavioral traits of these sublines, suggesting that inbreeding affects associative learning, particularly after long-term exposure to sweet stimuli which reflects high familiarization.\n",
      "Charles Darwin would have said that yawning was a useless piece of physiology. If so, then how should the survival of this very stereotyped behavior among the poikilothermal and homoeothermic vertebrates, from the basic brained reptiles to human primates, whether in the air, on the land or in the sea be understand? This issue of the ethnological, neurophysiologic and neuropsychological literature depicts yawning as being associated with an alternation of \"awake-sleep\" rhythms, sexuality, and nutrition, where it appears as a reference behavior of the mechanisms stimulating the state of vigilance. In pharmacology, yawning is used as an indicator of dopamine-ocytocinergic pathway activity, but in the Parkinson patient the neurologist sees it as an expression of therapeutic dopaminergic activity. J.M. Charcot and his school considered yawning as a clinical sign, long since forgotten. However, many patients complain about excessive yawning. Iatrogenic causes are the most frequent and can be found among many neurological diseases: vasovagal syncope, migraine, epilepsy, hypophyseal tumor, or stroke. Our ability to achieve motor and emotional behavior in resonance with others is deeply rooted in hominid evolution, and probably explains the strange phenomenon of contagious yawning.\n"

      "The aim of this study was to report on two patients with recurrent, paroxysmal, extracephalic pain triggered by yawning. Pain with yawning may occur in several conditions (secondary yawning pain) or develop in the absence of precipitating lesions (primary yawning pain). Primary yawning pain is normally of cephalic location. Methods used were clinical neurological examinations, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, computerized head tomography, electroencephalogram, blink reflex studies and Panorex X-ray views of the skull. The first patient had intense right shoulder pain and brief apnea for 2 years triggered by yawning. The second patient had yawning pain referred to an area of the neck where a thyroid tumour (Hürthle cell carcinoma) was later found. Neither of the two patients could precipitate their pain with imitation of yawning and neither had evidence of Eagle syndrome. Only the second patient had a history of migraine. Yawning pain may have an extratrigeminal and extracephalic distribution. It rarely serves to identify a lesion underlying the area where the pain is perceived.\n",

      "Yawning is contagious in human adults. While infants do not show contagious yawning, it remains unclear whether infants perceive yawning in the same manner as other facial expressions of emotion. We addressed this problem using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and behavioural experiments. We confirmed behaviourally that infants could discriminate between yawning and unfamiliar mouth movements. Furthermore, we found that the hemodynamic response of infants to a yawning movement was greater than that to mouth movement, similarly to the observations in adult fMRI study. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying yawning movement perception have developed in advance of the development of contagious yawning.\n",
      "Primates show various forms of behavioral contagion that are stronger between kin and friends. As a result, behavioral contagion is thought to promote group coordination, social cohesion, and possibly state matching. Aside from contagious yawning, little is known about the contagious effect of other behaviors. Scratching is commonly observed during arousal and as such may play a role within group dynamics. While the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) is commonly considered the least social great ape, orangutans do engage in social interactions. Therefore, their social organization makes them a suitable case for studying the social function of behavioral contagion. Through behavioral observations of captive orangutans, we recorded all yawn and scratch events together with the corresponding behavior of all bystander group-members. As yawning was rarely observed, no conclusions could be drawn regarding this behavior. Scratching was contagious and occurred within 90 s after the triggering scratch. Specifically, orangutans showed increased scratch contagion when they had seen a weakly bonded individual scratch during tense contexts. When the orangutan had not seen the triggering scratch, the contagiousness of scratching was not affected by context or relationship quality. Our results indicate that behavioral contagion is not simply higher between individuals with stronger social relationships, but that the contagiousness of behaviors may vary based on the context and on social factors. We discuss these findings in light of an adaptive function that may reduce aggression.\n",
      "A challenge in the study of yawning behavior is understanding the way external factors may modify it. This study investigated whether response-dependent punishment or random punishment decreased yawning by the application of buzzer noise paired with electric shocks in a high-yawning strain of Sprague-Dawley male rats. Yawn rate increased daily in response to the experimental cage, and also to the buzzer noise. Two alternate periods of no punishment and punishment were followed by a final period of buzzer noise occurring alone. Punishment did not diminish yawning significantly in either condition although the yawn rate increased in the following period of no punishment and in the buzzer-noise period, relative to the period of yawn-dependent punishment. Yawn rate increased in the buzzer-noise period relative to the first period of no punishment and first period of random punishment. These findings indicate that there are constraints that impede the suppression of yawning using punishment, and that yawning is a delayed response to fear produced by response-dependent punishment.\n",
      "To describe three patients with recurrent severe paroxysmal headache precipitated by yawning. Pain elicited by yawning is a well-recognized clinical phenomenon in patients with cranial neuralgia, temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome and Eagle syndrome. Clinical history, neurological and oral examinations, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cranial nerve electrophysiological testing and skull X-rays are reported. In all the patients pain was induced by yawning; in the third patient pain was also triggered by eructation. None had history of migraine. Facial gestures and forceful opening of the mouth did not reproduce the pain. The first patient had retroauricular pain, simvastatin-induced myopathy and subclinical axonal peripheral neuropathy; the second patient had a post-viral benign sensory neuropathy; and the third had retroauricular and facial pain and no underlying neurological illness. Cranial nerve testing and MRI of the brain were normal except for a coincidentally found pituitary adenoma on the first patient. Headache or cranial pain with yawning may occur in patients with no apparent cause (primary yawning headache). It is a chronic, benign condition that requires no specific treatment but needs to be distinguished from secondary yawning headache, of greater clinical relevance.\n",
      "The hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors is the mechanism by which dopamine agonists induce yawning and suppression of exploration is critically examined. It is shown that the relation between reduced extracellular dopamine levels, assessed by microdialysis, and behavioural effects of dopamine agonists, a dopamine synthesis inhibitor and a granule storage blocker is highly inconsistent. The time-course and duration of the behavioural effects of dopamine agonists differ from the reduction of extracellular dopamine. Amphetamine cotreatment is shown to increase dopamine levels, while yawning and suppression of exploration can still be induced. The data strongly indicate that autoreceptors are not the mediators of these behavioural effects. It is proposed that postsynaptic receptors mediate dopamine agonist induced yawning and suppression of exploration. Evidence is also presented showing that yawning and suppression of exploration are not functionally equivalent.\n",
      "Although deficits in cognitive empathy are well established in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the literature on emotional empathy, or emotional contagion, in individuals with ASD is sparse and contradictory. The authors tested susceptibility to contagious yawning and laughter in children with ASD (n = 60) and typically developing (TD) children (n = 60), ages 5-17 years, under various conditions, to elucidate factors that may affect emotional contagion in these populations. Although TD children showed equal amounts of emotional contagion across conditions, children with ASD were highly influenced by the familiarity of the target stimulus, as well as task instructions that encourage eye gaze to target. More specifically, children with ASD exhibited less contagious yawning and laughter than their TD peers except when their attention was explicitly directed to the eyes or (and even more so) when their parents served as the stimulus targets. The authors explore the implications of these findings for theories about the mechanisms underlying empathic deficits in ASD as well as the clinical implications of having parents involved in treatment.\n"

      "This work is to develop an intelligent driver-assistance system which can perceive the physiological state of a driver to avoid fatigue driving. The proposed system includes a camera, a wireless ElectroCardioGram (ECG) sensor patch, and a computation platform. The camera in front of a driver is to catch a face image which is processed to obtain features of a mouth for identifying a yawn. The sensor patch records ECG signals which are computed to yield six Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters. Seven healthy subjects of 6 males and 1 female had individually driven a car, which was embedded with our system, for 3 hours at a well-known route, mostly in a freeway road. Based on the captured video and measured ECG signals, the correlations between the yawning frequency and six HRV parameters are investigated by using the regression method to discover that the ratio (LF/HF) of Low-Frequency (LF) spectrum power over High-Frequency (HF) spectrum power yields the relatively highest correlation. In order to effectively identity driver's fatigue, the variations of differential LF/HF are further characterized to attain two thresholds which are accompanied with yawning frequencies to build a fair detection mechanism. The practical road tests demonstrate that the proposed system is very feasible and easily adapted to different drivers.\n",
      "Contagious yawning has been suggested to be a potential signal of empathy in non-human animals. However, few studies have been able to robustly test this claim. Here, we ran a Bayesian multilevel reanalysis of six studies of contagious yawning in dogs. This provided robust support for claims that contagious yawning is present in dogs, but found no evidence that dogs display either a familiarity or gender bias in contagious yawning, two predictions made by the contagious yawning-empathy hypothesis. Furthermore, in an experiment testing the prosociality bias, a novel prediction of the contagious yawning-empathy hypothesis, dogs did not yawn more in response to a prosocial demonstrator than to an antisocial demonstrator. As such, these strands of evidence suggest that contagious yawning, although present in dogs, is not mediated by empathetic mechanisms. This calls into question claims that contagious yawning is a signal of empathy in mammals.\n",
      "Yawn contagion is not restricted to humans and has also been reported for several non-human animal species, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Contagious yawning may lead to synchronisation of behaviour. However, the function of contagious yawning is relatively understudied. In this study, we investigated the function of contagious yawning by focusing on two types of signal providers: close social associates and leaders. We provided a captive chimpanzee colony with videos of all individuals of their own group that were either yawning, or at rest. Consistent with other studies, we demonstrated that yawning is contagious for chimpanzees, yet we did not find any effect of relationship quality on yawn contagion. However, we show that yawn contagion is significantly higher when the video model is a yawning male than when the video model was a yawning female, and that this effect is most apparent among males. As males are dominant in chimpanzee societies, male signals may be more relevant to the rest of the group than female signals. Moreover, since chimpanzees form male-bonded societies, male signals are especially relevant for other males. Therefore, we suggest that the sex-differences of yawning contagion among chimpanzees reflect the function of yawning in the synchronisation of behaviour.\n",
      "This study reports the first experimental exploration of possible contagious yawning in monkeys. Twenty-two stumptail macaques (Macaca arctoides) were presented with video clips of either yawns or control mouth movements by conspecifics. At a group level, monkeys yawned significantly more often during and just after the yawn tape than the control tape. Supplementary analysis revealed that the yawn tape also elicited significantly more self-directed scratching responses than the control tape, which suggests that yawning might have been caused by tension arising from viewing the yawn tape. Understanding to what extent the observed effect resembles contagious yawning as found in humans and chimpanzees requires more detailed experimentation.\n",

      "Yawning is a long neglected behavioral pattern, but it has recently gained an increasing interdisciplinary attention for its theoretical implications as well as for its potential use as a clinical marker, with particular regard to perinatal neurobehavioral assessment. The present study investigated the factors affecting yawning frequencies in hospitalized preterm neonates (N = 58), in order to distinguish the effects of hunger and sleep-related modulations and to examine the possible impact of demographic and clinical variables on yawning frequencies. Results showed that preterm neonates yawned more often before than after feeding, and this modulation was not explained by the amount of time spent in quiet sleep in the two conditions. Moreover, second born twins, known to be more prone to neonatal mortality and morbidity, showed increased yawning rates compared to first born twins. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that yawning frequencies in preterm neonates are modulated by separate mechanisms, related e.g. to hunger, vigilance and stress. These findings, although preliminary and based only on behavioral data, might indicate that several distinct neuropharmacological pathways that have been found to be involved in yawn modulation in adults are already observable in preterm neonates.\n",
      "Motion sickness is associated with a variety of autonomic symptoms, presumably due to proximity or functional interconnectivity between the autonomic centers in the brainstem and the vestibular system. A direct influence of the vestibular system on cardiovascular variables, defined as the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex, has been reported previously. Our aim was to investigate the sudomotor components of the autonomic responses associated with motion sickness during passive cross-coupling stimulation (\"roll while rotating\"). Healthy subjects (n = 17) were rotated at 40°/s around an earth-vertical yaw axis alone and in combination with sinusoidal roll oscillations (0.2 Hz). Motion sickness was assessed verbally every minute using a 1-10 scale, while recording DC and AC skin conductance levels (SCL) from the forehead. Yaw rotation alone provoked neither motion sickness nor variations of forehead sweating. Yet during cross-coupling stimulation all subjects reported motion sickness. Higher motion sickness scores (>5) were associated with significantly higher amplitudes of AC-SCL events compared to the lower scores (0.22 ± 0.01 vs. 0.11 ± 0.01 µS, respectively). Frequency domain analysis of the AC-SCL events revealed a peak at 0.2 Hz, coinciding with the frequency of the chair rolls. The total power of AC-SCL signals did not match the trend of motion sickness scores across conditions. We conclude that: (1) although SCL is related to motion sickness, it does not follow the perceived sickness closely; (2) the discrepancy between SCL and motion sickness and the rhythmic AC-SCL events could reflect a sudomotor component of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex.\n",
      "1. Recent experimental evidence has shown that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the expression of penile erection and yawning and that this molecule has to be added to the list of the best known neurotransmitters and neuropeptides involved in this symptomatology. 2. This was first suggested by the ability of NO synthase inhibitors injected in the lateral ventricles (i.c.v.) or in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to prevent these behavioral responses induced by dopamine agonists, oxytocin and NMDA. The inhibitory effect of NO synthase inhibitors was not observed when these compounds were injected concomitantly with L-arginine, the precursor of NO. Most important, this hypothalamic nucleus is one of the richest brain areas of NO synthase and also the brain site where dopamine, NMDA and oxytocin act to induce penile erection and yawning by activating central NO synthase containing oxytocinergic neurons. 3. NO synthase inhibitors given i.c.v. but not in the PVN prevent also penile erection and yawning induced by ACTH and serotonin1c agonists, which induce these responses by acting with mechanisms unrelated to oxytocinergic transmission. 4. Dopamine agonists, NMDA and oxytocin increase NO production in the PVN at doses that induce penile erection and yawning, as determined by measuring the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the dialyzate obtained with a vertical probe implanted in the PVN by in vivo microdialysis. 5. NO donors, such as nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside and hydroxylamine, induce penile erection and yawning indistinguishable from those induced by oxytocin, dopamine agonists or NMDA when injected in the PVN. The NO donor response was prevented by the i.c.v. injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5-Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin, indicating that these compounds also induce penile erection and yawning by activating oxytocinergic transmission. 6. Finally, guanylate cyclase inhibitors (i.e. methylene blue and LY 83583) and hemoglobin injected in the PVN do not prevent drug-induced penile erection and yawning, nor 8-Br-cGMP injected in the PVN induces these behavioral responses suggesting that the mechanism by means of which endogenous or NO donor-derived NO facilitates oxytocinergic transmission to induce penile erection and yawning is not related to the activation of guanylate cyclase. Furthermore, since hemoglobin, in spite of its ability to prevent drug-induced NO production in the PVN, does not prevent penile erection and yawning, it is likely that NO acts as an intracellular rather than an intercellular modulator in the PVN neurons in which is formed to facilitate the expression of these behavioral responses.\n"

      "Yawning behavior is characterized by mouth opening accompanied by deep inspiration, as well as arousal response, and is often observed not only in states of boredom or drowsiness, but also in stressful emotional situations in humans and animals. These phenomena suggest that yawning response may be an emotional behavior, possibly through activation of the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA), which is a critical region for emotional responses. However, the involvement of the CeA in triggering yawning remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether neuronal activation of the CeA by microinjection of L-glutamate into the CeA is able to induce stereotyped yawning responses in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. In addition, we assessed the effects of the CeA stimulation on the activation of oxytocin (OT) and CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which is responsible for induction of yawning, using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Microinjection of L-glutamate into the CeA causes an initial depressor response in the blood pressure and an arousal shift on the electrocorticogram followed by a single inspiration, which is the same as the typical pattern of the stereotyped yawning response induced by the PVN stimulation. In addition, the CeA stimulation activated the neuronal activities of both OT and CRF neurons in the PVN, as well as yawning responses. These results indicate that activation of the CeA is involved in the induction of yawning response, suggesting that yawning is an emotional behavior.\n",
      "Contagious yawning is thought to represent a basic form of empathy involved in state matching. Despite recent evidence in support of this connection, the neurochemical basis of contagious yawning remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate whether intranasal oxytocin, a hormone and neuropeptide involved in empathic processing, bonding and social affiliation, influences contagious yawning among human participants in a laboratory setting. Using a double blind procedure, 60 male college students received 30 IU of intranasal oxytocin or placebo and were then recorded during exposure to a contagious yawning video stimulus. Contrary to the empathic modeling hypothesis, oxytocin did not increase contagious yawning but rather appeared to modulate its expression in ways indicative of an enhanced awareness of the social stigma associated with this behavior. In particular, individuals in the oxytocin condition were more likely to conceal their yawns and less likely to display overt cues associated with the behavior. Follow-up research could explore how social context and affiliation with the target stimulus alter this response.\n",

      "Yawning is an involuntary sequence of mouth opening, deep inspiration, brief apnea, and slow expiration. Few cases of yawning as a clinical sign of epileptic seizures, ictally or postictally, have been reported. We report the video/EEG documentation of yawning as an ictal sign in a 31-year-old patient affected by drug-resistant focal epilepsy symptomatic of bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. Since the age of 10 she has had seizures characterized by yawning, staring, and eye blinking. Bilateral rhythmic frontotemporal spikes and waves characterized her EEG. We reviewed all reported cases and compared clinical and EEG features. We believe that yawning as part of an epileptic seizure might be considered a rare automatic behavior, like other automatisms frequently reported in epileptic seizures. Automatisms are more frequently described in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, and involvement of the temporal lobe in most of the published cases may have led to this explanation. It is possible that yawning within epileptic seizures could be considered activation of distinct symptomatogenic cortex rather than a release phenomenon. This rare ictal manifestation should be recognized as epileptic to avoid misdiagnosis and treatment failure.\n",

      "Intracerebral administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) elicits in experimental animals a yawning stretching behavior which is believed to reflect an arousal response mediated through the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. A surge in plasma ACTH levels at night and just prior to awakening from sleep is also associated in humans with yawning and stretching behavior. Recurrent episodes of uncontrollable yawning and body stretching, identical to those observed upon awakening from physiological sleep, occur in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during transcranial therapeutic application of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields of picotesla flux density. This behavioral response has been observed exclusively in young female patients who are fully ambulatory with a relapsing remitting course of the disease who also demonstrate a distinctly favorable therapeutic response to magnetic stimulation. ACTH is employed for the treatment of MS due to its immunomodulatory effects and a surge in its release in response to AC pulsed magnetic stimulation could explain some of the mechanism by which these fields improve symptoms of the disease.\n",
      "Considering that most of online training is not effectively supervised, this article presents an online leaning state assessment approach which combines blink detection, yawn detection, and head pose estimation. Blink detection is realized by computing the eye aspect ratio and the ratio of closed eye frames to the total frames per unit time to evaluate the degree of eye fatigue. Yawn detection is implemented by computing the aspect ratio of the mouth by using the feature points of the inner lip and combining it with the time of opening mouth to distinguish the mouth state. Head pose estimation is first implemented by calculating the head rotation matrix by matching the feature points of 2D face with the 3D face model and then calculating the Euler angle of the head according to the rotation matrix to evaluate the change of the head pose. Especially in yawn detection, we employ the feature points of inner lips in the calculation of the mouth aspect ratio to avoid the impact of lip thickness of various participants. Furthermore, the blink detection, yawn detection, and head pose estimation are first calculated based on the two-dimensional grayscale image of human face, which could reduce the computational complexity and improve the real-time performance of detection. Finally, combining the values of blinking, yawning, and head pose, multiple groups of experiments are carried out to assess the state of different online learners; then, the learning state is evaluated by analyzing the numerical changes of the three characteristics. Experimental results show that our approach could effectively evaluate the state of online learning and provide support for the development of online education.\n",
      "Contagious yawning occurs in humans and a few other highly social animals following the detection of yawns in others, yet the factors influencing the propagation of this response remain largely unknown. Stemming from earlier laboratory research, we conducted five experiments to investigate the effects of social presence on contagious yawning in virtual reality (VR). We show that, similar to a traditional laboratory setting, having a researcher present during testing significantly inhibited contagious yawning in VR, even though participants were viewing a virtual environment and unable to see the researcher. Unlike previous research, however, manipulating the social presence in VR (i.e., embedding recording devices and humanoid avatars within the simulation) did not affect contagious yawning. These experiments provide further evidence that social presence is a powerful deterrent of yawning in humans, which warrants further investigation. More generally, these findings also have important applications for the use of VR in psychological research. While participants were quite sensitive to social stimuli presented in VR, as evidenced by contagious yawning, our results suggest a major difference in the influence of social factors within real-world and virtual environments. That is, social cues in actual reality appear to dominate and supersede those in VR.\n"

      "Yawning is a significant behavioural response and, together with cortisol, is potentially a new diagnostic marker of neurological diseases. Evidence of an association between yawning and cortisol was found which supports the Thompson Cortisol Hypothesis and thermoregulation hypotheses, indication that brain cooling occurs when yawning. 117 volunteers aged 18-69 years were randomly allocated to experimentally controlled conditions to provoke yawning. Thirty-three had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Saliva cortisol samples were collected before and after yawning or after stimuli presentation in the absence of yawning. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, General Health Questionnaire, demographic and health details were collected. Comparisons were made of yawners and non-yawners, healthy volunteers and MS participants.\n",
      "Exclusion criteria: chronic fatigue, diabetes, fibromyalgia, heart condition, high blood pressure, hormone replacement therapy, stroke. Yawners had significant differences between saliva cortisol sample 1 and 2 among healthy participants (p < .007) and MS participants (p < .003). There was significant difference between the healthy versus MS non-yawners (P < .042) but not between yawners (p < .862). These results support the Thompson Cortisol Hypothesis suggesting that cortisol levels are elevated during yawning. Furthermore, this evidence suggests cortisol levels in the MS participants (non-yawners) are significantly different to those of healthy participants. Changes in cortisol levels may be similar in healthy and MS participants but when associated with observations of excessive yawning may become a new diagnostic tool in the early diagnosis of neurological symptoms.

      "Spontaneous yawning is a widespread behaviour in vertebrates. However, data on marine mammals are scarce. In this study, we tested some hypotheses on the functions of yawning in a captive group of South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens). According to the Dimorphism Hypothesis, species showing low levels of sexual dimorphism in canine size do not show sex differences in yawning distribution; this was supported by our findings, since yawning did not differ between the sexes. Yawning was more frequently performed during resting/sleeping contexts, thus supporting the Drowsiness Hypothesis. Yawning and self-scratching are considered reliable indicators of short-term anxiety in sea lions, since they immediately increased after conflicts both in aggressors and victims (Social Distress Hypothesis supported). In the long-term, yawning was not correlated with individuals' dominance status, thus showing that anxiety is similarly experienced by dominants and subordinates. The last two findings can be explained by the social competition of this species, that involves individuals independently from their sex, age or ranking status. Therefore, the exposure to frequent stressful events can induce similar levels of anxiety in all the subjects (Resource Inequity Hypothesis supported). In conclusion, spontaneous yawning in sea lions seems to share similar functions with other social mammals, suggesting that this behaviour is a possible plesiomorphic trait.\n",
      "Yawning and swallowing are fundamental physiological processes that are present from fetal stages throughout life and that involve sequential motor activities in the oropharyngo-larynx making it likely that they may share neuroanatomical pathways. We postulate that yawning and swallowing are controlled by a distributed network of brainstem regions including the central pattern generator of swallowing, and therefore spontaneous swallowing is frequently associated with spontaneous yawning. In this study, we sought to test this hypothesis by evaluating the elementary features of yawning in the facial, masseter and submental muscles, together with laryngeal movement sensor and respiratory recordings for spontaneous swallowing. We investigated 15 healthy, normal control subjects, 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 10 patients with brainstem stroke (BSS). Apart from four subjects with PD and two with BSS, who had dysphagia, none of the other study subjects were dysphagic by published criteria. Twenty-five subjects (10 control, 10 BSS, 5 PD) were evaluated by 1-h polygraphic recording, and 10 (5 control, 5 PD) underwent whole-night sleep recordings. One hundred thirty-two yawns were collected, 113 of which were associated with spontaneous swallows, a clear excess of what would be considered as coincidence. The yawns related with swallows could be classified into the following three categories. The characteristics or the duration of swallows and yawns were similar between controls and disease subjects, with the exception of increased duration of yawning in subjects with BSS. Our findings support the presence of common neuroanatomico-physiological pathways for spontaneous swallows and yawning.\n",

Females reported PS more frequently than males (81 versus 64%, p < 0.001) and experienced a higher number of different symptoms (mean 3.3 versus 1.8, p < 0.001). All measures of migraine severity were associated with a higher burden of PS. Light and sound sensitivity showed the highest co-occurrence (kappa = 0.51, 95% CI 0.47-0.55).

      "Background: Yawning is a stereotyped behavior that enhances blood flow to the skull, and the resulting counterflow has been hypothesized as a mechanism for brain cooling. Studies have shown that yawns are strongly associated with physiological and pathological conditions that increase brain temperature, and that they are followed by equivalent decreases in brain temperature. However, measured reductions in cranial or facial temperatures following yawning have yet to be reported, to our knowledge. To accomplish this, we used a subline of Sprague-Dawley rats that yawn at a much greater rate (20 yawns/h) than do outbred Sprague-Dawley rats (2 yawns/h).\n",
      "Results: Using an infrared camera, we effectively evaluated thermal changes in the cornea and concha of these rats before, during, and after yawns. The maximum temperature in both regions significantly decreased 10 s following yawns (concha: -0.3 °C, cornea: -0.4 °C), with a return to basal temperatures after 20 s.\n",
      "Conclusions: This study is the first clear demonstration of yawning-induced thermal cooling on the surface of the face, providing convergent evidence that this behavior plays a functional role in thermoregulation. As other studies have demonstrated that yawning is capable of reducing cortical brain temperature, our current data support the idea that yawning functions as a thermoregulator, affecting all structures within the head.\n"

In Study 1, birds were paired in adjacent cages with and without visual barriers, and the temporal association of yawning was assessed between visual conditions. In Study 2, the same birds were exposed to video stimuli of both conspecific yawns and control behavior, and yawning frequency was compared between conditions. Results from both studies demonstrate that yawning is contagious. To date, this is the first experimental evidence of contagious yawning in a non-mammalian species.

      "Yawning occurs more frequently in the early morning and in the late evening, close to sleep onset and after the awakening, and it might be linked to sleep propensity. We aimed to study yawning and its temporal distribution in morning and evening subjects who display different sleep-wake and sleepiness rhythms. Sixteen healthy young adults (8 evening-types and 8 morning-types, matched for age and gender) have been selected and instructed to keep their habitual sleep schedules and to signal every yawning occurrence for three consecutive days. Results show that evening-types yawn more frequently than morning-types, particularly during morning hours. Yawning frequency decreases across daytime in evening-types reaching its lowest level in the early evening and increases thereafter. Instead, in morning-types, yawning frequency remains quite low during daytime and increases in the evening. Moreover, both morning and evening types show a progressive increase of yawning frequency in the hours preceding sleep onset, whereas they differ after the awakening. Evening-types show a higher yawning frequency that remains quite stable in the hours following the awakening, while morning-types display a decline in yawning frequency. Our findings show that the temporal distribution of yawning frequency differs between chronotypes, supporting the hypothesis that differences in sleep-wake rhythm affect yawning, which could represent a behavioural sign of sleep propensity.\n",

      "Yawning is a common physiological phenomenon, induced by hunger, sleepiness or impersonation. Its behavioral aim seems to be an effort to vigilance. There are numerous pathological reasons explaining yawning, as for example global (infectious, metabolic and toxical) or focal neurological diseases. The modification of yawning in pathology where a dopaminergic dysfunction is to be found, as well as some data of animal experimentation, support when it takes place the dopaminergic system's implication. The pre-synaptical receptor's role had been suggested for a long time but actually yawning seems to be linked with a D1-D2 cooperation. The cholinergic system probably control a final effective pathway. We also imply the peptidergic, serotoninergic, androgine and opiace systems. If the localization of a putative center of yawning is impossible, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and the pituitary gland play a major role. Yawning can be used as a functioning index of the dopaminergic system in vivo in the human being.\n",

      "Research suggests that yawning provides a brain cooling function in homeotherms, and that excessive yawning may be a useful diagnostic indicator of abnormal thermoregulation in humans. Accordingly, the frequency of yawning should increase during instances of hyperthermia, but not fever (i.e., pyrexia), since this represents an elevation in the homeostatic set point rather than thermoregulatory failure. To our knowledge, no research has investigated the association between yawning frequency and fever in humans. Here we present the hypothesis that frequent yawning could be used as an initial signal for fever relief, either through the effectiveness of antipyretics or the natural break of a fever. Applications of this research include the improved behavioral monitoring of patients.\n",

Although less frequent than in older children and adults, spontaneous yawning by infants and preschoolers showed the typical morning, post-wakening peak, and an increase before bedtime in the evening. In an experimental study, infants and preschoolers watched a presentation that included many images of yawning and a repeated video clip of their own mother yawning, but there was no evidence of contagious yawning. The results suggest that, even when witnessing yawns by someone with whom they have a strong and positive emotional relationship, very young children do not show contagious yawning.\n",
      "Witnessing of conspecifics in pain has been shown to elicit socially triggered freezing in rodents. It is unknown how robust this response is to repeated exposure to a cage-mate experiencing painful stimulation. To address this question, shock-experienced Observer rats repeatedly witnessed familiar Demonstrators receive painful footshocks (six sessions). Results confirm that Observers freeze during the first testing session. The occurrence of this behaviour however gradually diminished as the experimental sessions progressed, reaching minimal freezing levels by the end of the experiments. In contrast, the appearance and continuous increase in the frequency of yawning, a behavior that was inhibited by metyrapone (i.e,. a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker), might represent an alternative coping strategy, suggesting that the observer's reduced freezing does not necessarily indicate a disappearance in the affective response to the Demonstrator's distress.\n",
      "Food and drugs can activate brain dopamine systems and sensitivity to the effects of drugs acting on those systems is influenced by amount and content of food consumed. This study examined the effects of drinking sucrose on behavioral effects of the direct-acting dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6/group) had free access to water or 10% sucrose and quinpirole dose-response curves (yawning and hypothermia) were generated weekly for 8 weeks. Subsequently, all rats drank water for 8 weeks with quinpirole dose-response curves determined on weeks 9, 10, and 16. In rats drinking sucrose, the ascending (D3 receptor-mediated), but not descending (D2 receptor-mediated), limb of the yawning dose-response curve shifted leftward. The D3 receptor-selective antagonist PG01037 shifted the ascending limb of the dose-response curve to the right in all rats. When rats that previously drank sucrose drank water, their sensitivity to quinpirole did not return to normal. Quinpirole-induced hypothermia was not different between groups. These data show that drinking sucrose increases sensitivity to a dopamine D3, but not D2, receptor-mediated effect and that this change is long lasting. Dopamine receptors mediate the effects of many drugs and the actions of those drugs are likely impacted by dietary factors.\n",
      "Yawning is contagious. However, little research has been done to elucidate the neuronal representation of this phenomenon. Our study objective was to test the hypothesis that the human mirror neuron system (MNS) is activated by visually perceived yawning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain activity during contagious yawning (CY). Signal-dependent changes in blood oxygen levels were compared when subjects viewed videotapes of yawning faces as opposed to faces with a neutral expression. In response to yawning, subjects showed unilateral activation of their Brodmann's area 9 (BA 9) portion of the right inferior frontal gyrus, a region of the MNS. In this way, two individuals could share physiological and associated emotional states based on perceived motor patterns. This is one component of empathy (motor empathy) that underlies the development of cognitive empathy. The BA 9 is reportedly active in tasks requiring mentalizing abilities. Our results emphasize the connection between the MNS and higher cognitive empathic functions, including mentalizing. We conclude that CY is based on a functional substrate of empathy.\n"

      "Accounts of behavior, including imitation, often suffer from philosopher's disease: the unnecessary, inappropriate, theoretically driven explanation of behavior in terms of cognition, rationality, and consciousness. Embryos are perversely unphilosophical and unpsychological, starting to move before they receive sensory input. Postnatal contagious yawning and laughing indicate that pseudo-imitative behavior can occur without conscious intent or other higher-order cognitive process.\n",
      "Previous observational research suggests that stretching is contagious in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). Here we report the first experimental evidence of this response through a reanalysis of a previous experiment testing for contagious yawning in this species. Using a repeated measures design, 16 birds were tested as pairs alongside familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics with and without visual barriers. Our results show that stretching behavior was temporally clustered only when the birds could see one another, corroborating previous observational findings supporting contagion. Additionally, for the first time, we show an ingroup bias in this response. That is, while the overall frequency of stretching did not significantly differ as a function of conspecific familiarity, contagious stretching was only present when cage mates were paired together. These findings are discussed in relation to recent research studying social cognition in this species. (PsycINFO Database Record\n",
      "Yawning and its involvement in neurological disorders has become the new scientific conundrum. Cortisol levels are known to rise during stress and fatigue; yawning may occur when we are under stress or tired. However, the link between yawning, fatigue, and cortisol has not been fully understood. Expansion of the Thompson Cortisol Hypothesis proposes that the stress hormone, cortisol, is responsible for yawning and fatigue especially in people with incomplete innervation such as multiple sclerosis. This informs our understanding of the functional importance of the brain stem region of the brain in regulating stress and fatigue.\n",

      "Human empathy can extend to strangers and even other species, but it is unknown whether non-humans are similarly broad in their empathic responses. We explored the breadth and flexibility of empathy in chimpanzees, a close relative of humans. We used contagious yawning to measure involuntary empathy and showed chimpanzees videos of familiar humans, unfamiliar humans and gelada baboons (an unfamiliar species). We tested whether each class of stimuli elicited contagion by comparing the effect of yawn and control videos. After including previous data on the response to ingroup and outgroup chimpanzees, we found that familiar and unfamiliar humans elicited contagion equal to that of ingroup chimpanzees. Gelada baboons did not elicit contagion, and the response to them was equal to that of outgroup chimpanzees. However, the chimpanzees watched the outgroup chimpanzee videos more than any other. The combination of high interest and low contagion may stem from hostility towards unfamiliar chimpanzees, which may interfere with an empathic response. Overall, chimpanzees showed flexibility in that they formed an empathic connection with a different species, including unknown members of that species. These results imply that human empathic flexibility is shared with related species.\n",
      "The primary function of yawning is not fully understood. We report a case in which electrical stimulation of the putamen in the human brain consistently elicited yawning. A 46-year-old woman with intractable epilepsy had invasive depth electrode monitoring and cortical stimulation mapping as part of her presurgical epilepsy evaluation. The first two contacts of a depth electrode that was intended to sample the left insula were in contact with the putamen. Stimulation of these contacts at 6mA and 8mA consistently elicited yawning on two separate days. Engagement in arithmetic and motor tasks during stimulation did not result in yawning. When considering the role of the putamen in motor control and its extensive connectivity to cortical and brainstem regions, our findings suggest that it plays a key role in the execution of motor movements necessitated by yawning. Furthermore, given the role of the anterior insula in attention and focused tasks, activation of this area while engaged in arithmetic and motor tasks could inhibit the putaminal processing necessary for yawning. Many have hypothesized the function of yawning; however, it remains debatable whether yawning serves a primarily physiological or communicative function or perhaps both.\n",
      "We report an experimental investigation into whether domesticated dogs display contagious yawning. Fifteen dogs were shown video clips of (1) humans and (2) dogs displaying yawns and open-mouth expressions (not yawns) to investigate whether dogs showed contagious yawning to either of these social stimuli. Only one dog performed significantly more yawns during or shortly after viewing yawning videos than to the open-mouth videos, and most of these yawns occurred to the human videos. No dogs showed significantly more yawning to the open-mouth videos (human or dog). The percentage of dogs showing contagious yawning was less than chimpanzees and humans showing this behavior, and considerably less than a recently published report investigating this behavior in dogs (Joly-Mascheroni et al. in Biol Lett 4:446-448, 2008).\n",
      "The recent interest in contagious yawning has raised several challenges as the varied methods of testing have left some unresolved issues. We do not know how differences in key variables affect the observed rates of yawning, and we highlight these as being in need of direct testing. Different researchers analyze their results differently, and we make some recommendations for more rigorous, thorough and informative analyses. Ultimately, problems arise when authors compare studies that used different methods and different analyses without acknowledging how these differences may have affected the results. In these cases, authors make inappropriate comparisons, which lead to conclusions that add confusion to the literature. Our goal in raising awareness of these issues is to generate new experiments and improve the discussion of existing research. With its link to empathy, a more standardized study of contagious yawning may be a useful tool for a variety of disciplines.\n",
      "This study reports the first experimental exploration of possible contagious yawning in monkeys. Twenty-two stumptail macaques (Macaca arctoides) were presented with video clips of either yawns or control mouth movements by conspecifics. At a group level, monkeys yawned significantly more often during and just after the yawn tape than the control tape. Supplementary analysis revealed that the yawn tape also elicited significantly more self-directed scratching responses than the control tape, which suggests that yawning might have been caused by tension arising from viewing the yawn tape. Understanding to what extent the observed effect resembles contagious yawning as found in humans and chimpanzees requires more detailed experimentation.\n",
      "A series of experiments in rats explored the possibility that D3/D2 dopamine receptors are involved in behaviors that might be related to compulsion. A series of D3/D2 agonists and antagonists were shown to elicit yawning (D3-receptor mediated) and its inhibition (D2-receptor mediated). In rats with histories of cocaine exposure, D3-agonist-elicited yawning was enhanced, and quinpirole led to persistent operant responding only if conditioned stimuli associated with cocaine were presented for responding. Finally, a more selective D3 partial agonist was reported that had a novel profile of activity that could have relevance to the suppression of dopamine-related compulsions.\n",
      "Incidental fetal yawning movements can rarely be observed during real-time ultrasonographic examination. In this report we document repetitive fetal yawning movements in a 27-week fetus over a 7-min period. Each episode lasted for 4-6 s, and the intervals between them varied from 21 to 195 s. This case demonstrated that fetal yawning, a complex involuntary behavioral reflex, is present in its full extent during the second half of pregnancy.\n"

      "The authors tested susceptibility to contagious yawning in 120 children, 1-6 years, to identify the time course of its emergence during development. Results indicated a substantial increase in the frequency of contagious yawning at 4 years. In a second study, the authors examined contagious yawning in 28 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 6-15 years. Children with ASD showed diminished susceptibility to contagious yawning compared with 2 control groups matched for mental and chronological age, respectively. In addition, children diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) a milder variant of autism, were more susceptible to contagious yawning than were children diagnosed with full Autistic Disorder. The authors explore the implications of these findings for theories about the development of mimicry and emotional contagion.\n",
      "We conducted a slow event-related fMRI experiment with naïve subjects' passively viewing yawn and various other control videos along with correlative behavioral testing. Specifically associated with the viewing of the contagious yawn was an area of activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest a role for the prefrontal cortex in the processing of contagious yawning, while demonstrating a unique automaticity in the processing of contagious motor programs which take place independently of mirror neuron networks.\n",
      "The thermoregulatory theory of yawning posits that yawns function to cool the brain in part due to counter-current heat exchange with the deep inhalation of ambient air. Consequently, yawning should be constrained to an optimal thermal zone or range of temperature, i.e., a thermal window, in which we should expect a lower frequency at extreme temperatures. Previous research shows that yawn frequency diminishes as ambient temperatures rise and approach body temperature, but a lower bound to the thermal window has not been demonstrated. To test this, a total of 120 pedestrians were sampled for susceptibly to self-reported yawn contagion during distinct temperature ranges and seasons (winter: 1.4°C, n=60; summer: 19.4°C, n=60). As predicted, the proportion of pedestrians reporting yawning was significantly lower during winter than in summer (18.3% vs. 41.7%), with temperature being the only significant predictor of these differences across seasons. The underlying mechanism for yawning in humans, both spontaneous and contagious, appears to be involved in brain thermoregulation.\n",
      "Here, we tested hypotheses about the potential functions of yawning based on its intensity and social contexts. Due to their spectrum intensity of yawns (covered teeth/YW1; uncovered teeth/YW2; uncovered gums/YW3), geladas are a good model species for this purpose. We suggest that yawns of different intensity can bear different information according to the performer, the context and the behavioural pattern temporally associated to the yawn event. YW3, mainly performed by high ranking males during periods of high social tension, was frequently associated with an auditory component and often accompanied by scratching (a measure of anxiety). YW1 and YW2, preferentially performed by females, were frequently associated to lip smacking, an affiliative display. In conclusion, even though a clear-cut functional distinction of geladas' yawn intensity is difficult, YW1 and YW2 seem to be more linked to affiliative social interactions; whereas, YW3 seems to be more linked to agonistic and tension situations.\n",
      "Yawning is related to sleep/wake transitions and time of day, probably reflecting the time course of sleepiness. As aging modifies sleep-wake and sleepiness rhythms, we suppose that yawning frequency and its time course vary as a function of age. Thirteen aged healthy subjects (77.15 +/- 4.09 years) and 12 young adults (24.41 +/- 3.31 years) were instructed to keep their habitual sleep schedules for three consecutive work-days, during which they were required to signal every yawning occurrence and to evaluate hourly their sleepiness level. Results showed that aged subjects yawn less frequently than young adults, particularly during morning and mid-afternoon hours. The time course of yawning was different between the two age groups: aged subjects showed earlier morning peak and evening rise compared with young adults; in addition, aged subjects showed two minor peaks in-between. Differences as a function of age in the time course of yawning were associated with differences in the time course of sleepiness. The only exception pertained to the early morning yawning peak, which was close to the awakening but it was not associated with high sleepiness in aged subjects. Our study discloses that aging modifies yawning frequency and its time course. Furthermore, as in the elderly yawning after the awakening is not associated with high sleepiness level as in young adult, we put forward that sleepiness level and the proximity of sleep/wake transitions could separately affect yawning.\n",

      "There is robust experimental evidence for contagious yawning, yet observational studies of naturalistic behavior have been fewer. Without data from real-world behavior, researchers have questioned the existence of contagious yawning and made assumptions about some parameters (e.g., the duration of the effect). We observed contagious yawning in chimpanzees to confirm/disconfirm its existence in the behavioral repertoire of this species, and if present, provide some of the missing descriptives. We recorded yawns on an all-occurrence basis from 18 captive-reared chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo. We recorded identity, time, and individuals who could have been affected. We calculated a threshold for contagion by taking the mean and adding 1.96 standard deviations, constructing a response curve. Across multiple measures we see a consistent pattern in which there is a strong effect of contagion for 1.5 minutes, a less strong but still significant effect lasting up to 3.5 minutes in some measures, and no evidence of contagion beyond 3.5 minutes. From the time stamp on each yawn we were able to rule out temporal synchrony as an alternative hypothesis. Thus, contagious yawning appears to be a natural phenomenon in chimpanzees lending support to the myriad experimental and observational studies to date.\n",
      "Objective: Yawning has been described in relation to drugs such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO B inhibitor, morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, dextromethorphan, benzodiazepine, lidocaine, and flecaine. This is a report of two patients, on long-term escitalopram therapy (more than 8 weeks) with stable dosing, who presented excessive yawning. Escitalopram is widely used in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n",

      "Humans favor others seen as similar to themselves (ingroup) over people seen as different (outgroup), even without explicitly stated bias. Ingroup-outgroup bias extends to involuntary responses, such as empathy for pain. However, empathy biases have not been tested in our close primate relatives. Contagious yawning has been theoretically and empirically linked to empathy. If empathy underlies contagious yawning, we predict that subjects should show an ingroup-outgroup bias by yawning more in response to watching ingroup members yawn than outgroup. Twenty-three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from two separate groups watched videos of familiar and unfamiliar individuals yawning or at rest (control). The chimpanzees yawned more when watching the familiar yawns than the familiar control or the unfamiliar yawns, demonstrating an ingroup-outgroup bias in contagious yawning. These results provide further empirical support that contagious yawning is a measure of empathy, which may be useful for evolutionary biology and mental health.\n"

      "People empathize with fictional displays of behaviour, including those of cartoons and computer animations, even though the stimuli are obviously artificial. However, the extent to which other animals also may respond empathetically to animations has yet to be determined. Animations provide a potentially useful tool for exploring non-human behaviour, cognition and empathy because computer-generated stimuli offer complete control over variables and the ability to program stimuli that could not be captured on video. Establishing computer animations as a viable tool requires that non-human subjects identify with and respond to animations in a way similar to the way they do to images of actual conspecifics. Contagious yawning has been linked to empathy and poses a good test of involuntary identification and motor mimicry. We presented 24 chimpanzees with three-dimensional computer-animated chimpanzees yawning or displaying control mouth movements. The apes yawned significantly more in response to the yawn animations than to the controls, implying identification with the animations. These results support the phenomenon of contagious yawning in chimpanzees and suggest an empathic response to animations. Understanding how chimpanzees connect with animations, to both empathize and imitate, may help us to understand how humans do the same.\n",
      "Fetal yawning is of interest because of its clinical, developmental and theoretical implications. However, the methodological challenges of identifying yawns from ultrasonographic scans have not been systematically addressed. We report two studies that examined the temporal dynamics of yawning in preterm neonates comparable in developmental level to fetuses observed in ultrasound studies (about 31 weeks PMA). In Study 1 we tested the reliability and construct validity of the only quantitative measure for identifying fetal yawns in the literature, by comparing its scores with a more detailed behavioral coding system (The System for Coding Perinatal Behavior, SCPB) adapted from the comprehensive, anatomically based Facial Action Coding System for Infants and Young Children (Baby FACS). The previously published measure yielded good reliability but poor specificity, resulting in over-representation of yawns. In Study 2 we developed and tested a new machine learning system based on support vector machines (SVM) for identifying yawns. The system displayed excellent specificity and sensitivity, proving it to be a reliable and valid tool for identifying yawns in fetuses and neonates. This achievement represents a first step towards a fully automated system for identifying yawns in the perinatal period.\n",
      "The term 'parakinesia brachialis oscitans' (PBO) was coined recently to describe cases of hemiplegia in which spontaneous yawning causes involuntary raising of the affected upper limb.

      "Sexual behavior plays a fundamental role for reproduction in mammals and other animal species. It is characterized by an anticipatory and a consummatory phase, and several copulatory parameters have been identified in each phase, mainly in rats. Sexual behavior varies significantly across rats even when they are of the same strain and reared under identical conditions. This review shows that rats of the same strain selectively bred for showing a divergent behavioral trait when exposed to stress or novelty (i.e. Roman high and low avoidance rats, bred for their different avoidance response to the shuttle box, and high and low novelty exploration responders rats, bred for their different exploratory response to a novel environment) or a spontaneous behavior with divergent frequency (i.e. low and high yawning frequency rats, bred for their divergent yawning frequency) show similar differences in sexual behavior, mainly in copulatory pattern, but also in sexual motivation. As shown by behavioral pharmacology and intracerebral microdialysis experiments carried out mainly in Roman rats, these sexual differences may be due to a more robust dopaminergic tone present in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system of one of the two sub-lines (e.g. high avoidance, high novelty exploration, and low yawning rat sub-lines). Thus, differences in genotype and/or in prenatal/postnatal environment lead not only to individual differences in temperament and environmental/emotional reactivity but also in sexual behavior. Because of the highly conserved mechanisms controlling reproduction in mammals, this may occur not only in rats but also in humans.\n",
      "Characterization of the effects of long-term alcohol consumption on the brain would be aided by the development of behavioral assays that are relatively easy to implement in animal models of alcohol use disorders. Assessing unconditioned behaviors, such as drug-elicited yawning in models that permit long-term alcohol ingestion, may be a valuable complement to more invasive and costly procedures. The present studies investigated previous unexpected findings of ethanol-induced yawning in nonhuman primates. Subjects were adult male rhesus monkeys (n = 8), all of which had experience self-administering intravenous cocaine for several years. Four monkeys also had experience consuming 2.0 g/kg ethanol over 1 h per day, 5 days per week, for 6.8-12.0 months. All monkeys received saline or ethanol (0.25-1.0 g/kg) infused intravenously (i.v.) over 10 min, and the number of yawns elicited during the infusion was counted. A second experiment in the ethanol-experienced monkeys examined whether ethanol-induced yawning could be blocked by PG01037 (1.0, 3.0 mg/kg, i.v.), a selective antagonist at dopamine D3 receptors (D3R). Ethanol significantly and dose-dependently increased yawns in the ethanol-experienced animals, but not the ethanol-naïve animals. In the ethanol-experienced monkeys, this effect of ethanol was blocked by the D3R antagonist. The pharmacology of yawning is complex and a good deal of model development remains to be performed to characterize the potential involvement of other neurotransmitter systems. Nonetheless, drug-elicited yawning may be a useful unconditioned behavioral assay to assess the effects of long-term alcohol consumption in established nonhuman primate models.\n",
      "Background: Although yawning is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically old phenomenon, its origin and purpose remain unclear. The study aimed at testing the widely held hypothesis that yawning is triggered by drowsiness and brings about a reversal or suspension of the process of falling asleep.\n",
      "Methods: Subjects complaining of excessive sleepiness were spontaneously yawning while trying to stay awake in a quiet and darkened room. Changes in their electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) associated with yawning were compared to changes associated with isolated voluntary body movements. Special care was taken to remove eye blink- and movement-artefacts from the recorded signals.\n",
      "Results: Yawns were preceded and followed by a significantly greater delta activity in EEG than movements (p< or =0.008). After yawning, alpha rhythms were attenuated, decelerated, and shifted towards central brain regions (p< or =0.01), whereas after movements, they were attenuated and accelerated (p<0.02). A significant transient increase of HRV occurred after the onset of yawning and movements, which was followed by a significant slow decrease peaking 17s after onset (p<0.0001). No difference in HRV changes was found between yawns and movements.\n",
      "Conclusions: Yawning occurred during periods with increased drowsiness and sleep pressure, but was not followed by a measurable increase of the arousal level of the brain. It was neither triggered nor followed by a specific autonomic activation. Our results therefore confirm that yawns occur due to sleepiness, but do not provide evidence for an arousing effect of yawning.\n",
      "Eating a high fat laboratory chow enhances sensitivity of rats to the behavioral effects of drugs that act on dopamine systems (e.g., cocaine). Further, in male rats, eating high fat chow impairs expression of insulin signaling phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt), which is vital for maintaining dopamine homeostasis. Eating high fat chow enhances sensitivity of female rats to drugs that act indirectly on dopamine receptors (e.g., cocaine); however, less is known about sensitivity of females to drugs that act directly on dopamine receptors (e.g., quinpirole). Further, it is not known if pAkt expression is impaired in female rats eating high fat chow. Some quinpirole-induced behaviors (e.g., penile erections and yawning) are either absent or occur at very low frequency in adult female rats. It is not known if quinpirole sensitivity in adolescent rats is more comparable between sexes. The present report examined another unconditioned behavioral effect (i.e., rearing) induced by once-weekly cumulative doses of quinpirole (0.0032-0.32mg/kg) in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats eating standard laboratory chow (17% kcal from fat) or high fat chow (60% kcal from fat), for several weeks throughout development, (spanning adolescence and early adulthood). Following behavioral assessments, pAkt expression was examined using western blot protein analysis. Eating high fat chow increased sensitivity of male rats to the quinpirole-induced yawning, as compared to male rats eating standard chow. However, other unconditioned behavioral effects of quinpirole (yawning and hypothermia) remained unchanged. Female rats yawned significantly less than male rats, and eating a high fat chow had no effect on any quinpirole-induced unconditioned behavioral effect in female rats. Eating high fat chow also reduced pAkt levels in male, but not female rats. Taken together, these data suggest that alternative behavioral and biochemical assays should be considered to measure sensitivity of female rats to the behavioral effects of dopamine receptor agonists, and further demonstrate the importance of studying drug sensitivity in both male and female subjects.\n"

      "Yawning is a familiar and phylogenetically widespread phenomenon, but no consensus exists regarding its functional significance. We tested the hypothesis that yawning communicates to others a transition from a state of physiological and/or psychological arousal (for example, due to action of a stressor) to a more relaxed state. This arousal reduction hypothesis predicts little yawning during arousal and more yawning (above baseline) during and after down-regulation of arousal. Experimental capture-restraint tests with wild adult Nazca boobies (Sula granti), a seabird, increased yawning frequency after release from restraint, but yawning was almost absent during tests. Natural maltreatment by non-parental adults also increased yawning by nestlings, but only after the maltreatment ended and the adult left. CORT (corticosterone) was a logical a priori element of the stress response affecting the stressor-yawning relationship under the arousal reduction hypothesis, and cannot be excluded as such for adults in capture-restraint tests but is apparently unimportant for nestlings being maltreated by adults. The arousal reduction hypothesis unites formerly disparate results on yawning: its socially contagious nature in some taxa, its clear pharmacological connection to the stress response, and its temporal linkage to transitions in arousal between consciousness and sleep.\n",

      "The temporal organization of masculine sexual behavior in rats is highly stereotyped; involving a sequence of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations. Sexual behavior has been described in exogamic and genetically manipulated rodent species. In this work, we compare the male sexual behavior of outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) to those of rats inbred for high (HY)- and low (LY)- spontaneous yawning frequency. In the first experiment, the percentage of inexperienced rats' ejaculatory behavior is significantly lower in the HY and LY respect to Sprague-Dawley rats. The latency to ejaculate for inexperienced HY was shorter than the LY and SD rats. In the second experiment, we examined the differences between inbred sublines and Sprague-Dawley rats once the subjects had become sexually experienced after four copulatory sessions. HY rats still have slower proportion of ejaculators respect to LY and SD rats. Additionally, postejaculatory latencies were longer for HY rats, with longer intercopulatory intervals and higher number of copulatory bouts that delayed ejaculation. Both sublines show lower copulatory efficiency respect to SD rats. In conclusion, both sublines show alterations in the temporal organization of sexual motor pattern that are due at least partially to strong inbreeding process to select them.\n",

Pathological yawning was more frequently observed in patients with cortical, insular, and opercular infarcts (p<0.05). Pathological yawning was related to higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores.

      "Results: There were 48 males and 27 females, whose median ages were 48 and 47 years, respectively. The median yawning onset times after stroke in males and females were 36 and 38 h, respectively. Associated movements in hemiplegic limbs during yawning were minimal and observed in 59 hemiplegics (78.6%); significantly more were seen in males (83%) vs. females (70%), left-sided (94%) vs. right-sided hemiplegics (64%), those with hypotonia (87%) vs. hypertonia (61%), and in the upper limbs (91%) vs. lower limbs (83%)and proximal (72%) vs. distal joints (29%), irrespective of limb.\n",
      "Conclusion: The appearance of associated movements in hemiplegic limbs indicates the return of ancestral function observed in quadrupeds. However, further studies are needed to ascertain the reasons for such variations and determine how to utilize these movements in rehabilitation programs.\n",

      "Chronic administration of opiates to laboratory animals induces supersensitivity of the dopamine receptors in the cerebral areas innervated by the mesotelencephalic dopamine pathways. In humans, the in vivo study of the sensitivity of the dopamine neurotransmitter system in Parkinson's patients can be done by means of the apomorphine test, which consists of measuring the number of yawns induced by the subcutaneous administration of low doses of apomorphine (0.005 mg/kg). If chronic opiate use in humans, as in experimental animals, results in supersensitivity of the dopamine systems, the apomorphine test could differentiate between heroin addicts and healthy volunteers, with the former showing greater number of yawns. In order to test this hypothesis we carried out the apomorphine test in two groups of subjects: a group of male heroin addicts attending our Addiction Treatment Centre for detoxification and the other group consisting of healthy volunteer male university students. Results showed that subcutaneous apomorphine administration induced a greater number of yawns (p < 0.05) in the group of heroin addicts as compared with the group of healthy volunteers, suggesting that heroin addicts present an enhanced sensitivity of the dopamine nuerotransmitter system.\n",
      "The present short note aimed at further exploring data from a recent study showing socially modulated auditory contagious yawning in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Two independent observers further extended the analysis of all video recordings made in the previous study and coded both the number of yawns performed by the dogs and the frequencies or durations of stress-related behaviors exhibited throughout the presentation of familiar and unfamiliar yawns. By showing no significant difference between conditions in the frequencies or durations of the coded behaviors, nor any association between the number of yawns and the frequencies or durations of stress-related behaviors, results raised doubt on the stress-induced yawn hypothesis, thus supporting social modulation. The exact mechanism underlying contagious yawning, however, needs further research.\n"

      "Mating behavior in rodents can modulate pain sensations in both sexes. In males, the execution of mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations induced a progressive increase in their vocalization thresholds induced by tail shocks and other types of noxious stimuli. We selectively inbred two sublines from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that differed in their spontaneous yawning frequency. The high-yawning (HY) subline had a mean of 20 yawns/h and a different pattern of sexual behavior characterized by longer interintromission intervals and more sexual bouts that delayed ejaculation. The low-yawning (LY) subline and SD rats yawned as a mean 2 and 1 yawns/h, respectively. So, we determine mating-induced analgesia in HY, LY, and SD male rats by measuring vocalization thresholds in response to noxious electric tail shocks. Our results showed that the magnitude of mating-induced analgesia was lower in HY and LY rats with respect to SD rats. When the rats performed different components of male sexual pattern, both sublines exhibited a significantly lower increase in their vocalization thresholds with respect to SD rats-being sublines less responsive regarding mating-induced analgesia. Pain modulation mechanisms depend on responses to stress, so the low levels of analgesia obtained in the yawning sublines may be due either to differences in their response to stress in other paradigms, or to atypical performance of male sexual behavior during mating, an event which as a stressful event in rats. Therefore, the yawning sublines are a suitable model for analyzing how a different temporal pattern in the display of male sexual behavior affects analgesia mechanisms. Our results concur with Wistar rats with different endophenotypes that could apply to humans as well.\n",
      "Background: Most cocaine abusers also abuse alcohol, but little is known about interactions that promote co-abuse. These experiments in rhesus monkeys determined the effects of >8 weeks of ethanol (EtOH) consumption on cocaine self-administration (n=6), effects of dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists on cocaine reinforcement (n=3-4 per drug) and the ability of the D2-like DA receptor agonist quinpirole to elicit yawning (n=3).\n",
      "Methods: Monkeys self-administered cocaine (0.0-1.0mg/kg/injection, i.v.) under a 300-s fixed-interval schedule and the above-listed variables were measured before EtOH exposure. Next, monkeys consumed a sweetened, 4% EtOH solution in the home cage under binge-like conditions: 1h, 5 days/week with daily intake equaling 2.0g/kg EtOH. After approximately 8 weeks, measures were re-determined, then EtOH drinking was discontinued. Finally, acute effects of EtOH on cocaine self-administration were determined by infusing EtOH (0.0-1.0g/kg. i.v.) prior to cocaine self-administration sessions (n=4).\n",
      "Results: In five of six monkeys, EtOH drinking increased self-administration of low cocaine doses but did not alter reinforcing effects of higher doses. Self-administration returned to baseline after EtOH access was terminated (n=3). Effects of DA receptor antagonists on cocaine self-administration were not consistently altered after EtOH consumption, but the ability of quinpirole to induce yawning was enhanced in two of three monkeys. Acute EtOH infusions only decreased self-administration of lower cocaine doses.\n",
      "Conclusions: Taken together, the data suggest that long-term EtOH exposure can increase sensitivity to cocaine, possibly by increasing D3 receptor sensitivity. Data do not support a role for acute pharmacological interactions in promoting cocaine/EtOH co-abuse.\n",
      "Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder characterised by fragility and multiple fractures of bones. Clinical signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of disease. Fractures of facial bones are rare compared with load-bearing long bones. We report a case of fracture of the mandible during yawning which was managed by open reduction and internal fixation.\n",
      "Dogs' capacity to 'catch' human yawns has recently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of animal cognition. Following recent studies suggesting that contagion yawning in humans, and some other primates, is empathy-related, some authors have considered the possibility that the same mechanism may underlie contagious yawning in dogs. To date, however, no positive evidence has been found, and more parsimonious hypotheses have been put forward. The present study explored the 'contagion-only' hypothesis by testing whether the mere sound of a human yawn can be sufficient to elicit yawning in dogs, in a way that is unaffected by social-emotional factors. Unexpectedly, results showed an interesting interplay between contagion and social effects. Not only were dogs found to catch human yawns, but they were also found to yawn more at familiar than unfamiliar yawns. Although not allowing for conclusive inferences about the mechanisms underlying contagious yawning in dogs, this study provides first data that renders plausible empathy-based, emotionally connected, contagious yawning in these animals.\n",
      "We have shown that repeated neonatal quinpirole (QUIN; a dopamine D2-like receptor agonist) treatment in rats produces long-lasting supersensitization of dopamine D2 receptors that persists into adulthood but without producing a change in receptor number. The current study was designed to analyze the effects of neonatal QUIN on auditory sensorimotor gating as measured through prepulse inhibition (PPI). Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were neonatally treated with QUIN (1mg/kg) or saline from postnatal days (P)1-21. At P60, the number of yawns was recorded for a 1h period in response to an acute QUIN (1mg/kg) injection as yawning is a D2-like receptor mediated behavioral event. Five days later, rats began (PPI) behavioral testing in two phases. In phase I, three different prepulse intensities (73, 76, and 82dB) were administered 100-ms before a 115dB pulse on 10 consecutive days. In phase II, three different interstimulus intervals (ISI; 50, 100, and 150ms) were inserted between the 73 or 76dB prepulse and 115dB pulse over 10 consecutive days of testing. A PPI probe trial was administered at the end of each phase after an acute 100μg/kgi.p. injection of QUIN to all animals. Replicating previous work, neonatal QUIN enhanced yawning compared to controls, verifying D2 receptor supersensitization. Regarding PPI, neonatal QUIN resulted in deficits across both phases of testing persistent across all testing days. Probe trial results revealed that acute QUIN treatment resulted in more robust PPI deficits in neonatal QUIN animals, although this deficit was related to prepulse intensity and ISI. These findings provide evidence that neonatal QUIN treatment results in deficits of auditory sensorimotor gating in adulthood as measured through PPI.\n",
      "Yawning is rare in herbivores which therefore may be an interesting group to disentangle the potential function(s) of yawning behaviour. Horses provide the opportunity to compare not only animals living in different conditions but also wild versus domestic species. Here, we tested three hypotheses by observing both domestic and Przewalski horses living in semi-natural conditions: (i) that domestic horses may show an elevated rate of yawning as a result of the domestication process (or as a result of life conditions), (ii) that individuals experiencing a higher level of social stress would yawn more than individuals with lower social stress and (iii) that males would yawn more often than females. The study involved 19 Przewalski horses (PHs) and 16 domestic horses (DHs) of different breeds living in large outdoor enclosures. The results showed that there was no difference between the PH and DH in yawning frequency (YF). PHs exhibited much higher levels of social interactions than DHs. There was a positive correlation between yawning frequency and aggressive behaviours in PHs, especially males, supporting the idea that yawning may be associated with more excitatory/stressful social situations. A correlation was found between yawning frequency and affiliative behaviours in DHs, which supports the potential relationship between yawning and social context. Finally, the entire males, but not castrated males, showed much higher levels of yawning than females in both species. The intensity (rather than the valence) of the interaction may be important in triggering yawning, which could therefore be a displacement activity that helps reduce tension.\n"

      "This study is the first to report the disturbance of contagious yawning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-four children with ASD as well as 25 age-matched typically developing (TD) children observed video clips of either yawning or control mouth movements. Yawning video clips elicited more yawns in TD children than in children with ASD, but the frequency of yawns did not differ between groups when they observed control video clips. Moreover, TD children yawned more during or after the yawn video clips than the control video clips, but the type of video clips did not affect the amount of yawning in children with ASD. Current results suggest that contagious yawning is impaired in ASD, which may relate to their impairment in empathy. It supports the claim that contagious yawning is based on the capacity for empathy.\n",
      "Low risk, premature infants between 30 to 35 weeks post-conceptual age (PCA) residing in an neonatal intensive care unit environment were observed in the home incubator for spontaneous yawning from 2400 to 0500 hr. Videorecordings were analyzed for the behavioral states of quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), wake (W), and drowse (D) in 3-min epochs as well as the contextual behaviors before and after yawn events using a 1-min window. Yawning periods predicted higher levels of motoric activation than nonyawn periods. Sequence analysis of preceding and following states with or without yawns were examined for stability or change. All states with or without yawn events had state stability for the preceding and following epochs, with two exceptions: 1) D state with yawning was associated with state change in the preceding 3-min epoch (most often W), and 2) D state without yawning was associated with state change in the following epoch (W or AS). Yawns were not present in QS. The results suggest that yawning is associated with increased behavioral arousal that is not state-specific. However, yawning in D state predicts state transitions in the preceding, but not the following, epoch. It is proposed that D may be an unstable state that becomes more stable when yawning is present.\n",
      "Excessive yawning has been reported in the peri-ictal period preceding or following seizures. We describe an exceptional case of an elderly man with impairment of consciousness and paroxysmal excessive yawning. We hypothesise that this can be regarded as an autonomic seizure originating from diencephalic/brainstem structures, manifesting with yawning as an ictal phenomenon.\n",
      "Yawning, a phylogenetic behavior, present in reptiles, birds and mammals, has been studied for several decades, but to date its physiological function is still unknown. The role of stress as well as several peptides and the hypothalamus has been studied in relation to its regulation. To date however, no studies has been carried out to determine the role of the adrenal glands. Therefore, yawning behavior was studied in adrenalectomized rats, who then received dexamethasone replacement. The results show that rats whose adrenal glands were removed stopped both spontaneous and apomorphine-induced yawning, while dexamethasone reverted this effect. The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of corticosterone on yawning behavior.\n",

      "Background: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from thermoregulatory dysfunction, and repetitive yawning and sleep problems are symptoms of MS. Because yawning and sleep are involved in thermoregulation, we investigated the association between yawning, sleep, and symptom relief in patients with MS.\n",
      "Methods: Sixty patients filled out a questionnaire about how often they yawned, whether yawning provided relief of MS symptoms, and how sleep affected these symptoms.\n",
      "Results: Results showed that over one in three patients reported that their MS symptoms improved following a yawn, and of those experiencing relief, nearly half reported that it lasted for several minutes or longer. Not getting a good night's sleep often made MS symptoms worse, while napping during the day provided symptom relief.\n",
      "Conclusion: This is the first study showing that yawning provides symptom relief in patients with multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "The beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid induced penile erection and yawning in a dose dependent manner when given intraperitoneally (IP, 0.05-5mg/kg), perorally (OS, 0.1-5mg/kg) and intracereboventricularly (ICV, 0.01-5 μg/rat) to male rats. The effect resembles that of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine given subcutaneously (SC) (0.02-0.25mg/kg), although the responses of the latter followed a U inverted dose-response curve, disappearing at doses higher than 0.1mg/kg. Clavulanic acid responses were reduced by about 55% by haloperidol, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (0.1mg/kg IP), and by d(CH(2))(5)Tyr(Me)(2)-Orn(8)-vasotocin, an oxytocin receptor antagonist (2 μg/rat ICV), both given 15 min before clavulanic acid. A higher reduction of clavulanic acid responses (more than 80%) was also found with morphine, an opioid receptor agonist (5mg/kg IP), and with mianserin, a serotonin 5HT(2c) receptor antagonist (0.2mg/kg SC). In contrast, no reduction was found with naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist (1mg/kg IP). The ability of haloperidol, d(CH(2))(5)Tyr(Me)(2)-Orn(8)-vasotocin and morphine to reduce clavulanic acid induced penile erection and yawning suggests that clavulanic acid induces these responses, at least in part, by increasing central dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine in turn activates oxytocinergic neurotransmission and centrally released oxytocin induces penile erection and yawning. However, since both penile erection and yawning episodes were reduced not only by the blockade of central dopamine and oxytocin receptors and by the stimulation of opioid receptors, which inhibits oxytocinergic neurotransmission, but also by mianserin, an increase of central serotonin neurotransmission is also likely to participate in these clavulanic acid responses.\n",
      "Yawn contagion in humans has been proposed to be related to our capacity for empathy. It is presently unclear whether this capacity is uniquely human or shared with other primates, especially monkeys. Here, we show that in gelada baboons (Theropithecus gelada) yawning is contagious between individuals, especially those that are socially close, i.e., the contagiousness of yawning correlated with the level of grooming contact between individuals. This correlation persisted after controlling for the effect of spatial association. Thus, emotional proximity rather than spatial proximity best predicts yawn contagion. Adult females showed precise matching of different yawning types, which suggests a mirroring mechanism that activates shared representations. The present study also suggests that females have an enhanced sensitivity and emotional tuning toward companions. These findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning reveals an emotional connection between individuals. This phenomenon, here demonstrated in monkeys, could be a building block for full-blown empathy.\n",
      "Introduction: Severe motion sickness is easily identifiable with sufferers showing obvious behavioral signs, including emesis (vomiting). Mild motion sickness and sopite syndrome lack such clear and objective behavioral markers. We postulate that yawning may have the potential to be used in operational settings as such a marker. This study assesses the utility of yawning as a behavioral marker for the identification of soporific effects by investigating the association between yawning and mild motion sickness/sopite syndrome in a controlled environment.\n",
      "Methods: Using a randomized motion-counterbalanced design, we collected yawning and motion sickness data from 39 healthy individuals (34 men and 5 women, ages 27-59 yr) in static and motion conditions. Each individual participated in two 1-h sessions. Each session consisted of six 10-min blocks. Subjects performed a multitasking battery on a head mounted display while seated on the moving platform. The occurrence and severity of symptoms were assessed with the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ).\n",
      "Results: Yawning occurred predominantly in the motion condition. All yawners in motion (N = 5) were symptomatic. Compared to nonyawners (MSAQ indices: Total = 14.0, Sopite = 15.0), subjects who yawned in motion demonstrated increased severity of motion sickness and soporific symptoms (MSAQ indices: Total = 17.2, Sopite = 22.4), and reduced multitasking cognitive performance (Composite score: nonyawners = 1348; yawners = 1145).\n",
      "Discussion: These results provide evidence that yawning may be a viable behavioral marker to recognize the onset of soporific effects and their concomitant reduction in cognitive performance.\n"

      "As a dark and not fully understood side of human nature, yawning is believed to be a signs of various physiological or pathological behaviors of human. In this study, we aimed to investigate the importance of yawning in the evaluation of sleepiness. One hundred and twenty-nine snorers who were suspected to have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome underwent polysomnography and were asked to fill the Epworth sleepiness scale. The number of yawnings of patients was counted during the day following polysomnography. Patients were stratified into two groups: those have apnea hypopnea index <5 (n = 43, group 1) and those have apnea hypopnea index >30 (n = 86, group 2). Mean duration of sleep phases, oxygen saturations, sleep efficacies, yawning frequencies and Epworth scores of the groups were compared. Correlations of yawning frequency with Epworth scores, duration of sleep phases and mean oxygen saturations were investigated. Sleep efficacies were similar between the groups (p > 0.05). Yawning frequencies in group 1 and group 2 were 43.48 and 75.76 (mean rank), respectively (p < 0.01). Mean N1, N2, N3 phase durations and oxygen saturations were significantly lower in group 2 (p < 0.01). While there was a negative correlation between yawning frequency and duration of the non-REM phases and mean oxygen saturation (r = -0.53 and r = -0.31, respectively, p < 0.05), yawning frequency was positively correlated with Epworth scores (r = 0.46, p < 0.05). In addition to the shortened phases of sleep, increased Epworth score and decreased oxygen saturation, increased yawning frequency may indicate sleep deprivation.\n",
      "Rationale: Feeding conditions modify sensitivity to indirect- and direct-acting dopamine receptor agonists as well as the development of sensitization to these drugs.\n",
      "Objectives: This study examined whether feeding condition affects acute sensitivity to apomorphine-induced yawning or changes in sensitivity that occur over repeated drug administration. Quinpirole-induced yawning was also evaluated to see whether sensitization to apomorphine confers cross-sensitization to quinpirole.\n",
      "Methods: Drug-induced yawning was measured in different groups of male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6/group) eating high (34.3%) fat or standard (5.7% fat) chow.\n",
      "Results: Five weeks of eating high-fat chow rendered otherwise drug-naïve rats more sensitive to apomorphine- (0.01-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and quinpirole- (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg, i.p.) induced yawning, compared with rats eating standard chow. In other rats, tested weekly with apomorphine, sensitivity to apomorphine-induced yawning increased (sensitization) similarly in rats with free access to standard or high-fat chow; conditioning to the testing environment appeared to contribute to increased yawning in both groups of rats. Food restriction decreased sensitivity to apomorphine-induced yawning across five weekly tests. Rats with free access to standard or high-fat chow and sensitized to apomorphine were cross-sensitized to quinpirole-induced yawning. The hypothermic effects of apomorphine and quinpirole were not different regardless of drug history or feeding condition.\n",
      "Conclusions: Eating high-fat chow or restricting access to food alters sensitivity to direct-acting dopamine receptor agonists (apomorphine, quinpirole), although the relative contribution of drug history and dietary conditions to sensitivity changes appears to vary among agonists.\n",
      "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Nepeta cataria (NC), catnip, induces pleasure in cats and humans.\n",
      "Aim of the study: Because sexual behavior is involved in pleasure, the effect of NC on sexual behavior and penile erection was evaluated in male rats that were acutely fed chow enriched with 10% NC leaves. Further, yawning was monitored because we previously demonstrated that NC modifies dopaminergic-related behaviors and that sexual behavior is closely linked with the dopaminergic system. The general activity and the motor coordination were examined to investigate the possible motor and emotional interferences of the sexual performance.\n",
      "Material and methods: Male rats of the NC group received for a 4h period the chow enriched with 10% NC leaves while the control groups received regular chow. Fifteen min after the end of the 4h period of NC feeding the sexual behavior, apomorphine-induced penile erection and motor coordination were observed; the general activity in the open field was assessed 0, 15, 30 and 60 min after treatment.\n",
      "Results: NC treatment increased male rat's penile erection. A slightly facilitation on male rat sexual behavior and a decreased in general activity of NC treated rats were observed. No effects on motor coordination and yawning episodes were detected by the NC treatment.\n",
      "Conclusions: It was suggested that NC increases penile erection and slightly improves male rat sexual behavior by an action on dopaminergic systems.\n",
      "Yawning occurs frequently in daily life and is often attributed to boredom and fatigue. Rarely, it may be a symptom of serious underlying medical illness, primarily involving the central nervous system.

The patient manifested striking repetitive yawning that resolved immediately after pericardial drainage. An association between repetitive yawning and acute cardiac tamponade has not been previously described.\n",
      "Systemic administration of D2-like dopaminergic-receptor agonists increases yawning behavior. However, only a few studies have been done in animals with pathological conditions. The taiep rat is a myelin mutant with an initial hypomyelination followed by progressive demyelination, being the brainstem one of the most affected areas. In our experiments, we analyzed the effects of systemic administration of the D2-family agonists and antagonists on yawning behavior, and correlated them with the lipid myelin content in the brainstem and other areas in the central nervous system (CNS) in 8 month old male taiep and Sprague-Dawley rats. Subjects were maintained under standard conditions in Plexiglas cages with a 12:12 light-dark cycle, lights on at 0700 and free access to rodent pellets and tap water. Drugs were freshly prepared injected ip at 0800 and subjects were observed for 60 min. When antagonists were used it was administered 15 min before the agonist. Sprague-Dawley and taiep rats significantly increased their yawning frequency after systemic injection of (-)-quinpirole hydrochloride, R(+)-7-Hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (7-OH-DPAT) or trans-(±)-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano [4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol hydrochloride ((±)-PD 128,907). Among D2-like agonists used higher effects are obtained with (-)-quinpirole. The effects caused by (-)-quinpirole can be reduced by (-)-sulpiride; and yawning caused by 7-OH-DPAT was decreased by tiapride only in taiep rats. In Sprague-Dawley only (-)-sulpiride is able to decrease (-)-quinpirole-caused yawning. In conclusion, dopaminergic D2-like agonists are still able to cause yawning despite the severe myelin loss in taiep rats. Similarly, patients with various CNS illnesses that affect myelin, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, are able to yawn suggesting that trigger neurons are still able to command this innate behavior.\n",

      "Yawning has been observed in foetuses and preterm infants. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and the 24 h distribution of yawning in preterm infants. Twelve low-risk infants between 31 and 40 weeks of post-conceptional age (PCA) were continuously video-recorded for 24 h in their incubator. Spontaneous yawning was defined as opening of the mouth to its full extension in a dramatic stretch movement. The results showed that the rate of yawning across the 24-h period was 1.10/h. The highest incidence of yawns was in the waking motility pattern when compared to active sleep or quiet sleep motility patterns. Between 31 and 40 weeks, yawn incidence significantly decreased mainly during the day. The marked decrease in yawn frequency with age may be related to the development of circadian and homeostatic control of sleep and wake.\n"

      "Pandiculation is the involuntary stretching of the soft tissues, which occurs in most animal species and is associated with transitions between cyclic biological behaviors, especially the sleep-wake rhythm (Walusinski, 2006). Yawning is considered a special case of pandiculation that affects the musculature of the mouth, respiratory system and upper spine (Baenninger, 1997). When, as often happens, yawning occurs simultaneously with pandiculation in other body regions (Bertolini and Gessa, 1981; Lehmann, 1979; Urba-Holmgren et al., 1977) the combined behavior is referred to as the stretch-yawning syndrome (SYS). SYS has been associated with the arousal function, as it seems to reset the central nervous system to the waking state after a period of sleep and prepare the animal to respond to environmental stimuli (Walusinski, 2006). This paper explores the hypothesis that the SYS might also have an auto-regulatory role regarding the locomotor system: to maintain the animal's ability to express coordinated and integrated movement by regularly restoring and resetting the structural and functional equilibrium of the myofascial system. It is now recognized that the myofascial system is integrative, linking body parts, as the force of a muscle is transmitted via the fascial structures well beyond the tendonous attachments of the muscle itself (Huijing and Jaspers, 2005). It is argued here that pandiculation might preserve the integrative role of the myofascial system by (a) developing and maintaining appropriate physiological fascial interconnections and (b) modulating the pre-stress state of the myofascial system by regularly activating the tonic musculature. The ideas presented here initially arose from clinical observations during the practice of a manual therapy called Muscular Repositioning (MR) (Bertolucci, 2008; Bertolucci and Kozasa, 2010a; Bertolucci, 2010b). These observations were supplemented by a review of the literature on the subject. A possible link between MR and SYS is presented: The neural reflexes characteristically evoked through MR are reminiscent of SYS, which both suggests that MR might stimulate parts of the SYS reaction, and also points to one of MR's possible mechanisms of action.\n",
      "Rates of wrist activity and yawning were recorded continuously for 7-15 days in adult human male and female subjects. In the 15 min following 747 yawns wrist motion increased reliably in all subject records. The data were consistent with an hypothesis that yawning is predictive of an increase in activity level. In a second study, data from daily logs kept by 45 subjects confirmed previous findings that yawning frequency is unrelated to prior amount of sleep, or to times of awaking or retiring. More yawning occurred during the week than during weekends.\n",
      "Purpose: Either the calcium (Ca(2+))-channel blocker nicardipine or the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist landiolol may be intravenously (IV) administered to reduce the hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation. In this study, we examined the effects of these drugs on the yawning response elicited by intravenous thiopental in humans.\n",
      "Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, 180 consenting American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients undergoing elective surgery were recruited. In a double-blind, randomized design, three groups of 60 patients each received one of the following intravenous injections: (1) landiolol 0.1 mg/kg (L-group), (2) nicardipine 0.02 mg/kg (N-group), or (3) saline (S-group). In all patients, anesthesia was subsequently induced IV with 4 mg/kg thiopental. Thereafter, the occurrence of the yawning response (characterized by mouth opening) was continuously assessed as the only clinical endpoint for 1 min. Throughout the study, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded at 1-min intervals.\n",
      "Results: The incidence of the yawning response was lower in both the L-group (6.7%) and the N-group (16.7%) than in the S-group (46.7%) (each, P < 0.01).\n",
      "Conclusions: Prior intravenous administration of either a Ca(2+)-channel blocker or a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist can greatly reduce the thiopental-induced yawning response in humans.\n",
      "Yawning is contagious in humans and some non-human primates. If there are social functions to contagious behaviors, such as yawning, they might occur in other highly social vertebrates. To investigate this possibility, we conducted an observational study of yawning and an associated behavior, stretching, in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a social, flock-living parrot. Flock-housed budgerigars were videotaped for 1.5h at three time-blocks during the day (early morning, afternoon and early evening), and the times of all yawns and stretches for each bird were recorded. Both yawning and stretching were temporally clumped within sessions, but were uniformly distributed across the trials of a particular time-block. This suggests that clumping was not a result of circadian patterning and that both behaviors could be contagious. There was additional evidence of contagion in stretching, which occurred in two forms - a posterior-dorsal extension of either one foot or both feet. Birds that could have observed a conspecific stretch, and that then stretched themselves within 20s, replicated the form of the earlier stretch significantly more often than expected by chance. This study provides the first detailed description of temporal patterns of yawning under social conditions in a flock-living species as well as the first support for contagious yawning and stretching in a non-primate species in a natural context. Experimental evidence will be necessary to confirm the extent of contagion in either behavior.\n",
      "The interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways in the induction of behavioral responses has been previously established. In the brain, M2 receptors are found predominantly in presynaptic cholinergic neurons as autoreceptors, and in dopaminergic neurons as heteroceptors, suggesting a control role of acetylcholine and dopamine release, respectively. Our aim was to investigate the role of M2 receptors on the yawning and genital grooming of rats induced by apomorphine, a dopaminergic receptor agonist, focusing on the interaction between cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways. Initially, the effect of atropine, a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, on yawning and genital grooming induced by apomorphine (100 μg/kg s.c.) was analyzed. Atropine doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg i.p. were administered to Wistar rats 30 min before induction of the behavioral responses by apomorphine. Number of yawns and time spent genital grooming were quantified over a 60 min period. Apomorphine-induced yawning was increased by low dose (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) but not by high doses (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) of atropine. Genital grooming was antagonized by 2 mg/kg i.p. of atropine and showed no changes at the other doses tested. Tripitramine, a selective M2 cholinergic antagonist, was used as a tool for distinguishing between M2 and all other muscarinic receptor subtypes in yawning and genital grooming. Tripitramine doses of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 μmol/kg i.p. were administered to Wistar rats 30 min before apomorphine (100 μg/kg s.c.). Number of yawns and time spent genital grooming were also quantified over a 60 min period. Tripitramine 0.01 μmol/kg increased all parameters. Higher doses, which possibly block all subtypes of muscarinic receptor, did not modify the response of apomorphine, suggesting a non-selective effect of tripitramine at these doses. Given that low doses of tripitramine increased the behavioral responses induced by apomorphine and that the main distribution of the M2 receptor is presynaptic, we raised the hypothesis that tripitramine may alter cholinergic and/or dopaminergic transmission in brain areas responsible for induction of yawning and genital grooming in rats, possibly by control of acetylcholine and/or dopamine release. In addition, the present study showed the involvement of M2 cholinergic receptors in the complex mechanisms of functional interactions between dopaminergic and cholinergic systems involved in the control of yawning and genital grooming.\n"

      "Migraine patients usually exhibit hypersensitivity to dopaminergic agonists, but the tests used (such as the so called \"piribedil test\") preferentially assess the sensitivity of the peripheral dopaminergic receptors. Apomorphine-induced yawning may be useful in the evaluation of central dopaminergic receptor sensitivity. Nine migraine patients were included in an age- and sex-matched control study. They had been without treatment for 1 month and free of a migraine attack for at least 7 days. Apomorphine hydrochloride (5 micrograms/kg) was administered subcutaneously, and yawning was recorded by two observers. The cumulative number of yawns as a function of time was studied. The comparison of the regression graphs showed a significant difference between migraine patients and controls. Migraine patients exhibited enhanced responsiveness to apomorphine challenge. This finding supports the hypothesis of a constant central dopaminergic hypersensitivity.\n",
      "Yawning and spontaneous blink rate (SBR) are two physiological reflexes which have been incompletely examined but one neurobiological step of these two behaviours seems, at least in part, dopamine-dependent. The reference dopaminergic agonist, apomorphine hydrochloride (0.5, 1, and 2 micrograms kg-1 s.c.), was compared with a placebo in a double-blind latin-square design, and was shown to induce yawning and increase SBR in a population of eight healthy volunteers. These two behavioral effects were not dose-related. The individual SBR differences were correlated with the individual number of yawns for all the four treatments at the 10-30 min interval. Thus, parallel yawning and SBR behaviour suggests a similar pharmacological mechanism. Apomorphine-induced yawning and blinking may be therefore of use in the evaluation of central dopaminergic pathways in man.\n",
      "Acute administration of metoclopramide, a dopamine (D2) antagonist, reduced both apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections. Metoclopramide, prominent in clinical use as an effective antiemetic, has been shown to be associated with decreased erectile function in humans. Experimentally naive rats were given a standardized dose of apomorphine and one of a range of doses of metoclopramide. The study shows that metoclopramide decreases the erectile response to apomorphine and suggests that the erectile difficulties experienced in humans after metoclopramide treatment may be a result of interference with a central dopaminergic mechanism(s).\n",

      "Yawning has been proposed to serve both physiological and social functions, the latter likely to have developed later in its evolution. A central hypothesis is that yawning cools the brain but whether yawning is a thermoregulatory mechanism that is activated during hyperthermia (i.e., thermoregulatory failure) or is activated in any instance of brain temperature increase (e.g., also during fever) is unclear and experimental assessments of yawning during fever are lacking. In this study, we determined the effect of experimentally induced fever on yawning frequency. We also explored alternative predictors of yawning during sickness (sleepiness, autonomic nervous system indexes and sickness symptoms). Twenty-two healthy human subjects participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, where the subjects received an injection of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 2ng/kg body weight in one condition and placebo in the other. Yawning was scored from video recordings from 30min before to 4h after the injection. Body temperature was measured frequently, alongside with heart rate, blood pressure, nausea and overall sickness symptoms. Yawning frequency was found to significantly increase over time during experimentally induced sickness, but not in the placebo condition. In particular, yawning frequency was increased during the rising phase of body temperature induced by LPS administration, although no significant correlation was found between body temperature increase and yawning frequency. In addition, exploratory analyses showed that a higher yawning frequency was associated with less increase in sickness symptoms and nausea intensity. While the current study adds to previous research showing significant increase in yawning frequency during hyperthermia, further studies are needed if we are to properly characterize the brain cooling role of yawning in humans. The investigation of other functions, such as being a vasovagal inhibitory, may shed stronger light on the functions of yawning.\n",
      "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reportedly fail to show contagious yawning, but the mechanism underlying the lack of contagious yawning is still unclear. The current study examined whether instructed fixation on the eyes modulates contagious yawning in ASD. Thirty-one children with ASD, as well as 31 age-matched typically developing (TD) children, observed video clips of either yawning or control mouth movements. Participants were instructed to fixate to the eyes of the face stimuli. Following instructed fixation on the eyes, both TD children and children with ASD yawned equally frequently in response to yawning stimuli. Current results suggest that contagious yawning could occur in ASD under an experimental condition in which they are instructed to fixate on the yawning eyes.\n",
      "Yawning, although easily recognized, is difficult to explain. Traditional explanations stressed physiological mechanisms, but more recently, behavioral processes have received increasing attention. This is the first study to test a range of hypotheses on yawning in wild primate populations. We studied two sympatric strepsirrhine species, Lemur catta, and Propithecus verreauxi, of the Ankoba forest (24.99°S, 46.29°E, Berenty reserve) in southern Madagascar. Sexual dimorphism is lacking in both species. However, their differences in ecological and behavioral characteristics facilitate comparative tests of hypotheses on yawning. Our results show that within each species males and females yawned with similar frequencies supporting the Dimorphism Hypothesis, which predicts that low sexual dimorphism leads to little inter-sexual differences in yawning. In support of the State Changing Hypothesis yawning frequencies was linked to the sleep-wake cycle and punctuated transitions from one behavior to another. Accordingly, yawning frequencies were significantly higher in L. catta than in P. verreauxi, because L. catta has a higher basal level of activity and consequently a higher number of behavioral transitions. In agreement with the Anxiety Hypothesis, yawning increased significantly in the 10 min following predatory attacks or aggression. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence of a direct connection between anxiety and yawning in lemurs. Our results show that yawning in these two strepsirrhines occurs in different contexts, but more research will be necessary to determine if yawns are a single, unitary behavior.\n",
      "The last decades have seen an increasing interest in the phenomenon of yawning and the dynamics of its modulation, yet no widespread consensus exists on its origins and potential functions. Although most scholars have focused on its potential physiological functions, e.g., related to thermoregulation, arousal modulation or cortisol levels and distress, an emerging line of research has been also investigating the social implications of yawning, including its hypothesized relationship with empathy. In order to explore the dynamics of yawning modulation in infants, we investigated whether a social perturbation-like the one induced by the Face to Face Still Face paradigm, a procedure designed to assess socio-emotional regulation in infants-affects yawning and self-touch hand movements behavior in three-months old infants. As the Still Face episode represents a source of mild distress, we hypothesized that during this phase yawns would be more frequent. Moreover, through the use of path analysis, we investigated potential dynamics of facilitation, inhibition or covariance between the frequencies of these behavioral patterns. Our results showed a sharp increase in self-touch hand movements as well as in the likelihood of yawning during the stressful phase of the procedure (still-face) compared with the two minutes of face-to-face interaction and the reunion episode. Regressions also showed a higher incidence of yawns among girls, consistently with the hypothesis that the analysis of yawning behavior might capture subtle differences in regulatory strategies of infants, possibly related to the transient sex-specific activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis known as mini-puberty. The path analysis showed a greater consistency between the frequencies of self-touch hand movements during the three episodes of the procedure, compared with yawning. This finding could be a result of distinct yawning-regulating mechanisms being at play in different conditions, e.g., a modulation related to stress and one to social interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that human yawning regulation is an irreducibly complex and multifaceted phenomenon since early age. Moreover, the gender differences highlighted might suggest an early diversification in yawning modulation.\n"

      "Methods: All the observations with 'yawning' reported in the French Pharmacovigilance Database until December 2004 were reviewed. We recorded drug(s) involved, characteristics of patients (age, sex and underlying disease) and of ADR (seriousness, delay in occurrence, evolution, imputability).\n",
      "Results: Twenty-eight reports were recorded between 1985 and December 2004. The sex ratio of the patients included in these reports was 1.5 and the mean age was 46.2 (2-78) years. Thirty-eight drugs were involved, mainly serotoninergic agents (serotonin reuptake inhibitors [12]), dopaminergic agents (levodopa [3], dopamine agonists [3], monoamine oxidase B inhibitor [1]), opioids (morphine [1], methadone [1], buprenorphine [1], dextromethorphan [1]), benzodiazepines (4) and sodium channel inhibitors (lidocaine [2], flecainide [1]). Four ADRs were rated 'serious' (leading to hospitalisation). Patient outcome was usually favourable after drug withdrawal.\n",
      "Conclusion: Despite its necessary methodological drawbacks (mainly under-reporting), this study reveals that several drugs may induce yawning in humans. Our work also indicates that stimulation of central dopamine or serotonin receptors elicits yawning in humans. This study underlines the role of several drugs in yawning and shows that this ADR is not systematically listed in the summary product characteristic even when it can be explained by the pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs.\n",

      "Dopaminergic (DA) agonist-induced yawning in rats seems to be mediated by DA D3 receptors, and low doses of several DA agonists decrease locomotor activity, an effect attributed to presynaptic D2 receptors. Effects of several DA agonists on yawning and locomotor activity were examined in rats and mice. Yawning was reliably produced in rats, and by the cholinergic agonist, physostigmine, in both the species. However, DA agonists were ineffective in producing yawning in Swiss-Webster or DA D2R and DA D3R knockout or wild-type mice. The drugs significantly decreased locomotor activity in rats at one or two low doses, with activity returning to control levels at higher doses. In mice, the drugs decreased locomotion across a 1000-10 000-fold range of doses, with activity at control levels (U-91356A) or above control levels [(+/-)-7-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin HBr, quinpirole] at the highest doses. Low doses of agonists decreased locomotion in all mice except the DA D2R knockout mice, but were not antagonized by DA D2R or D3R antagonists (L-741 626, BP 897, or PG01037). Yawning does not provide a selective in-vivo indicator of DA D3R agonist activity in mice. Decreases in mouse locomotor activity by the DA agonists seem to be mediated by D2 DA receptors.\n",

      "The function of the paranasal sinuses has been a controversial subject since the time of Galen, with many different theories advanced about their biological significance. For one, the paranasal sinuses have been regarded as warmers of respiratory air, when in actuality these structures appear to function in cooling the blood. In fact, human paranasal sinuses have been shown to have higher volumes in individuals living in warmer climates, and thus may be considered radiators of the brain. The literature suggests that the transfer of cool venous blood from the paranasal sinuses to the dura mater may provide a mechanism for the convection process of cooling produced by the evaporation of mucus within human sinuses. In turn, the dura mater may transmit these temperature changes, initiated by the cool venous blood from the heat-dissipating surfaces of the sinuses, to the cerebrospinal fluid compartments. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated in cadaveric dissections that the thin bony posterior wall of the maxillary sinus serves as an origin for both medial and lateral pterygoid muscle segments, an anatomic finding that had been previously underappreciated in the literature. The present authors hypothesize that the thin posterior wall of the maxillary sinus may flex during yawning, operating like a bellows pump, actively ventilating the sinus system, and thus facilitating brain cooling. Such a powered ventilation system has not previously been described in humans, although an analogous system has been reported in birds.\n",
      "The effects on penile erection and yawning of subcutaneous (SC) injections of the mixed dopamine D1/D2-like agonist apomorphine (0.02-0.2 mg/kg) were studied in outbred Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) male rats, two lines selectively bred for their respectively rapid versus poor acquisition of the active avoidance response in the shuttle-box, and compared with the effects observed in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Apomorphine dose-response curves were bell-shaped in all rat lines/strains. Notably, more penile erections and yawns were recorded mainly in the ascending part of these curves (e.g., apomorphine 0.02-0.08 mg/kg) in both RLA and RHA rats compared to SD rats, with RLA rats showing the higher response (especially for yawning) with respect to RHA rats. Similar results were found with PD-168,077 (0.02-0.2 mg/kg SC), a D4 receptor agonist, which induced penile erection but not yawning. In all rat lines/strains, apomorphine responses were markedly reduced by the D2 antagonist L-741,626, but not by the D3 antagonist, SB277011A, whereas the D4 antagonists L-745,870 and FAUC213 elicited a partial, yet statistically significant, inhibitory effect. In contrast, the pro-erectile effect of PD-168,077 was completely abolished by L-745,870 and FAUC213, as expected. The present study confirms and extends previously reported differences in dopamine transmission between RLA and RHA rats and between the SD strain and the Roman lines. Moreover, it confirms previous studies supporting the view that dopamine receptors of the D2 subtype play a predominant role in the pro-yawning and pro-erectile effect of apomorphine, and that the selective stimulation of D4 receptors induces penile erection.\n",
      "Yawning may serve both social and nonsocial functions. When budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) are briefly held, simulating capture by a predator, the temporal pattern of yawning changes. When this species is observed in a naturalistic setting (undisturbed flock), yawning and also stretching, a related behavior, are mildly contagious. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that a stressful event would be followed by the clustering of these behaviors in a group of birds, which may be facilitated both by a standard pattern of responding to a startling stressor and also contagion. In this study, we measured yawning and stretching in 4-bird groups following a nonspecific stressor (loud white noise) for a period of 1 hr, determining whether auditory disturbances alter the timing and frequency of these behaviors. Our results show that stretching, and to a lesser degree yawning, were nonrandomly clumped in time following the auditory disturbances, indicating that the temporal clustering is sensitive to, and enhanced by, environmental stressors while in small groups. No decrease in yawning such as found after handling stress was observed immediately after the loud noise but a similar increase in yawning 20 min after was observed. Future research is required to tease apart the roles of behavioral contagion and a time-setting effect following a startle in this species. This research is of interest because of the potential role that temporal clumping of yawning and stretching could play in both the collective detection of, and response to, local disturbances or predation threats.\n"

      "In this study, the effects of intraperitoneal (ip) injection of physostigmine, subcutaneous (sc) injection of atropine, and intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of histamine, chlorpheniramine (H(1)-receptor antagonist), and ranitidine (H(2)-receptor antagonist) in separate and combined treatments were investigated during yawning in rats. Physostigmine at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg produced the highest number of yawns. Atropine, used alone, was without effect, but physostigmine (0.25 mg/kg, ip)-induced yawning was blocked by pretreatment with atropine (1 mg/kg, sc). Histamine at the doses of 10, 20 and 40 microg produced yawning. Chlorpheniramine and ranitidine, used alone, had no effect, whereas pretreatments with chlorpheniramine and ranitidine at the same dose of 80 microg prevented histamine (40 microg, icv)-induced yawning. The suppressive effect of chlorpheniramine was more than that of ranitidine. Histamine (10 and 40 microg, icv) enhanced, whereas chlorpheniramine and ranitidine at the same dose of 80 microg suppressed, physostigmine (0.25 mg/kg, ip)-induced yawning. Atropine (1 mg/kg, sc) not only suppressed histamine-induced yawning, but also enhanced the inhibitory effect of chlorpheniramine, but not of ranitidine on yawning induced by histamine. These results indicate that muscarinic receptors mediate yawning induced by physostigmine. Histamine central H(1), and to a lesser extent H(2) receptors, may be involved in histamine-induced yawning. Cholinergic muscarinic receptors, as well as histaminergic H(1) and to a lesser extent H(2) receptors, may lso be involved in the interaction between brain acetylcholine and histamine.\n",
      "High- and low-yawning rats (HY and LY) were selectively bred as a function of their spontaneous yawning frequency with the LY subline about 2 yawns/hr and the HY 20 yawns/hr. The HY rats have more grooming bouts and travel longer distances in an open field. HY dams spent less time in the nest, retrieved their pups faster, and show a longer latency to licking and mouthing the pups than the LY or outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) animals. The percentage of HY dams that had atypical retrieving was higher, with a lower nest quality, and produced offspring whose weights were lower than those from the LY subline. We also showed that the pregnant HY dams have fewer pups and the percentage that had lost at least three pups during lactation was higher than the SD and LY dams. In conclusion, HY dams are motivated to take care of their pups, but the \"fine tuning\" of maternal care is disturbed.\n",
      "Comparative research suggests that yawning is a thermoregulatory behavior in homeotherms. Our previous experiments revealed that yawning increased in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) as ambient temperature was raised toward body temperature (22-->34 degrees C). In this study, we identify the range of temperatures that triggers yawning to rule out the possible effect of changing temperature in any range. To corroborate its thermoregulatory function, we also related the incidence of yawning to other avian thermoregulatory behaviors in budgerigars (e.g., panting, wing venting). In a repeated measures design, 16 budgerigars were exposed to 4 separate 10-min periods of changing temperatures: (a) low-increasing (23-->27 degrees C), (b) high-increasing (27-->33 degrees C), (c) high-decreasing (34-->28 degrees C), and (d) low-decreasing (28-->24 degrees C). Birds yawned significantly more during the high-increasing temperature range, and yawning was positively correlated with ambient temperature across trials. Yawning was also positively correlated with other thermoregulatory behaviors. This research clarifies the previously demonstrated relationship between yawning rate and temperature by providing evidence that the physiological trigger for yawning is related to increasing body temperatures rather than the detection of changing external temperatures.\n",
      "Erectile dysfunction is a serious and common complication of diabetes mellitus. The proposed mechanisms for erectile dysfunction in diabetes include central and autonomic neuropathy, endothelial dysfunction, and smooth muscle dysfunction. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is known to be involved in centrally mediated penile erection. This study was designed to examine the role of nitric oxide (NO) within the central nervous system component of the behavioral responses including erection in diabetic rats. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced erection, yawning, and stretch through the PVN can be blocked by prior administration of NO synthase (NOS) blocker, L-NMMA, in freely moving, conscious male normal rats. Four weeks after streptozotocin (STZ) and vehicle injections, NMDA-induced erection, yawning, and stretch responses through the PVN are significantly blunted in diabetic rats compared with control rats. Examination of neuronal NOS (nNOS) protein by Western blot analysis indicated a reduced amount of nNOS protein in the PVN of rats with diabetes compared with control rats. Furthermore, restoring nNOS within the PVN by gene transfer using adenoviral transfection significantly restored the erectile and yawning responses to NMDA in diabetic rats. These data demonstrate that a blunted NO mechanism within the PVN may contribute to NMDA-induced erectile dysfunction observed in diabetes mellitus.\n",

The isthmus region could only be passed using an 0.8-mm fiberscope. In all cases, it was possible to insert the endoscope into the middle ear cavity. Eleven of the 12 tube examinations showed normal findings. The mobility of the tubal cartilage could be visualized with sufficient quality. In 50% of all examinations, application of local anesthesia via a tube catheter was necessary to make the procedure tolerable.\n",
      "Conclusion: The presented approach allows an assessment of both anatomic and functional changes to the eustachian tube in awake patients. The assessment of middle ear structures is limited. To ensure a comfortable and safe procedure, the use of topical anesthesia in a supine position and, in certain cases, additional anesthesia via eustachian tube catheter is recommended.\n",
      "Yawning occurs in various conditions such as hypoxia, epilepsy, and sleep disorders including sleep apnea. Intractable yawning associated with a brain tumor has been rarely reported. A 19-year-old woman presented with intractable yawning. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor in the supramedial cerebellum that compressed the dorsal side of the midbrain and upper pons. After subtotal removal of the tumor, the yawning completely disappeared. Postoperative MRI showed resolution of compression of the brainstem. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as a mature teratoma. The present case suggested that the intractable yawning resulted from the tumor compressing the dorsal side of the junction between the midbrain and pons.\n",

Test-retest reliability of the 10 performed oral behaviors generally ranged from 0.6 to 0.98 for all 3 muscle groups, and many tasks had reliability coefficients comparable to those for the biceps curl. Across tasks, elevator muscle reliability of cases was 0.87, compared to 0.75 for controls; group values for opening muscles were similar.\n",
      "Conclusion: Individual subjects performed each task at a high level of consistency.

      "The main aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the incidence and lateralizing value of peri-ictal yawning in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent successful surgery for epilepsy (Engel class I outcome at the 2-year follow-up visit). We reviewed a total of 97 patients (59 men and 38 women). Fifty-three patients had TLE arising from the nondominant temporal lobe, and 44 had TLE arising from the dominant temporal lobe. In total, we reviewed 380 seizures. Of those, 202 seizures arose from the nondominant temporal lobe and 178 from the dominant one. Peri-ictal yawning was observed in 4 of 97 patients (4.1%) and in 7 of 380 seizures (1.8%), in the postictal period in all cases. Peri-ictal yawning occurred only in patients with right-sided, nondominant TLE. It may have a lateralizing value.\n",
      "Almost all the vertebrates yawn, testifying the phylogenetic old origins of this behavior. Correlatively speaking, yawning shows an ontogenical precociousness since it occurs as early as 12 weeks after conception and remains relatively unchanged throughout life. Thus, it is contended that these common characteristics and their diencephalic origin allow to model an approach from which emerges a pivotal link between yawning and REM sleep. Yawning and stretching reverse the muscular atonia of the REM-sleep and reopen the collapsed airways. Yawning appears as a powerful muscular stretch, recruiting specific control systems particularly the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the locus coeruleus and the reticular activating system from which the vigor of this ancestral vestige, surviving throughout evolution with little variation, may increase arousal. On the other hand, the James-Lange theory proposes that afferent feedback from muscles and viscera provides the brain with a feeling that characterizes the active motivational state and arousal. On this basis and using selected supporting findings from the literature and from data provided by daily life, it is contended that yawning takes part in interoceptiveness by its capacity to increase arousal and self-awareness. Adaptative behaviors depend on interactions among the nervous system and the body by a continuous feedback between them. The body's schema is a main component of the self, and interoceptive process is essential to awareness of the body and arousal. Yawning contributes to bodily consciousness as a behavior affiliating a sensory motor act and his perception from which pleasure is derived. Yawning can be seen as a proprioceptive performance awareness which inwardly provides a pre-reflective sense of one's body and a reappraisal of the body schema. The behavioral consequences of adopting specific regulatory strategies and the neural systems involved act upon attention and cognitive changes.Thus, it is proposed that yawning is a part of interoceptiveness by its capacity to increase arousal and self-awareness.\n",

      "Study objectives: To investigate the proportion of propofol-induced yawning and sympathovagal balance during propofol-induced yawning.\n",
      "Design: Prospective, observational, clinical study.\n",
      "Setting: University hospital and 2400-bed tertiary medical center.\n",
      "Patients: 546 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing elective surgery with general anesthesia.\n",
      "Interventions: Standard induction of anesthesia was performed with intravenous (IV) propofol two to four mg/kg (group P), or pretreatment with atropine 0.1 mg/kg (group AP) or with fentanyl 1 to 3 microg/kg (group FP) before propofol. Continuous standard electrocardiogram for heart rate variability (HRV) was performed in another 20 patients to investigate sympathovagal balance during propofol-induced yawning.\n",
      "Measurements and main results: The proportions of yawning were 53.5% (207/386), 61.1% (55/90), and 0% (0/50) in the P, AP, and FP groups, respectively. Propofol-induced yawning could be dramatically decreased by pretreatment with IV fentanyl (P < 0.001, chi2 test). Significant increased ratio of low-frequency/high-frequency power was detected during HRV monitoring in 9 patients with yawning in comparison with 11 patients without yawning (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\n",
      "Conclusions: Pretreatment with fentanyl may inhibit propofol-induced yawning. Fluctuations in autonomic function have been noted during propofol-induced yawning.\n",
      "Contagious yawning is a common, but poorly understood phenomenon. We hypothesized that contagious yawning is part of a more general phenomenon known as mental state attribution (i.e. the ability to inferentially model the mental states of others). To test this hypothesis we compared susceptibility to contagiously yawn with performance on a self-face recognition task, several theory of mind stories, and on a measure of schizotypal personality traits. Consistent with the hypothesis, susceptibility to contagiously yawn was positively related to performance on self-face recognition and faux pas theory of mind stories, and negatively related to schizotypal personality traits. These data suggest that contagious yawning may be associated with empathic aspects of mental state attribution and are negatively affected by increases in schizotypal personality traits much like other self-processing related tasks.\n",

      "The investigation of biological phenomena in impotence using an animal system requires a determination of the erectile capabilities of the animal. Rats respond reliably to apomorphine by the exhibition of a phenomenon of erections and yawns. This property has been used to form the basis of a bio-assay of erectile integrity in the rat. We compared rats treated with placebo alone, sham operated rats, rats rendered surgically impotent and castrated rats with and without testosterone. Rats did not respond to placebo. The sham operated rats remained normal in all measured respects (2.66 erections/rat/30 minutes). Surgically impotent rats yawned normally but had no erections. Castrated rats did not have erections and had diminished yawning (3.21 yawns/rat/30 minutes vs. 7.7 for controls p less than .001) but responded normally after testosterone administration. The bio-assay is useful as a standard test of erectile function in the rat.\n",
      "The effect of feeding schedules on the daily rhythm in spontaneous yawning activity was studied in high yawning (HY) Sprague-Dawley rats. If the animals are fed ad libitum and changed from a standard 12-12 light-dark (LD) illumination regime to constant light (LL), the normal predark circadian peak in yawning disappears, to be replaced, after 3 weeks, by two or more ultradian smaller peaks in yawning frequency. Restriction of food availability to 2-2:30 regular hours of the day, in rats under LL conditions, leads to the appearance of a significant preprandial (food anticipatory) peak in yawning. A similar eating-fasting daily cycle of 2-22 h in rats under LD conditions determines the disappearance of the pre-dark peak in yawning activity, and a significant shift in higher yawning frequency towards the couple of hours preceding food availability. This result suggests that restricted feeding is more potent than the LD transition in the entrainment of the daily rhythm in yawning activity.\n",
      "Rats lesioned shortly after birth with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 134 μg icv) represent a near-ideal model of severe Parkinson's disease because of the near-total destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers. The element manganese, an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, itself in toxic amount, replicates some clinical features similar to those of Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of neonatal manganese exposure on 6-OHDA modeling of Parkinson's disease in rats. Manganese (MnCl(2)·4H(2)O) 10,000 ppm was included in the drinking water of pregnant Wistar rats from the time of conception until the 21st day after delivery, the age when neonatal rats were weaned. Control rats consumed tap water. Other groups of neonatal rat pups, on the 3rd day after birth, were pretreated with desipramine (20 mg/kg ip 1 h) prior to bilateral icv administration of 6-OHDA (30, 60, or 137 μg) or its vehicle saline-ascorbic (0.1%) (control). At 2 months after birth, in rats lesioned with 30, 60, or 134 μg 6-OHDA, endogenous striatal dopamine (DA) content was reduced, respectively, by 66, 92, and 98% (HPLC/ED), while co-exposure of these groups to perinatal manganese did not magnify the DA depletion. However, there was prominent enhancement of DA D(1) agonist (i.e., SKF 38393)-induced oral activity in the group of rats exposed perinatally to manganese and also treated neonatally with the 30 mg/kg dose of 6-OHDA. The 30 mg/kg 6-OHDA group, demonstrating cataleptogenic responses to SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg ip), developed resistance if co-exposed to perinatal manganese. In the group exposed to manganese and lesioned with the 60 mg/kg dose of 6-OHDA, there was a reduction in D(2) agonist (i.e., quinpirole, 0.1 mg/kg)-induced yawning. The series of findings demonstrate that ontogenetic exposure to manganese results in an enhancement of behavioral toxicity to a moderate dose of 6-OHDA, despite the fact that there is no enhanced depletion of striatal DA depletion by the manganese treatment.\n"

      "In the present study, a novel sexual behavior paradigm was used to study the effects of the dopamine agonist, apomorphine, on male sexual behavior of rhesus monkeys. In Experiment 1, the effects of apomorphine treatment were assessed by observing the behavioral responses of male rhesus to a sexually receptive female monkey that they could see, hear, and smell, but could not physically contact. Apomorphine treatment produced a spectrum of behavioral effects that differed depending on the dose of drug administered. Low doses of apomorphine (25-100 micrograms/kg) stimulated yawning, moderate doses (50-200 micrograms/kg) facilitated male sexual responses associated with the genitals including penile erection and masturbation, and high doses (greater than 200 micrograms/kg) elicited stereotypic behavior. Experiment 2 examined whether the behavioral responses of male monkeys to apomorphine treatment were influenced by the stimulus female. Apomorphine treatment facilitated penile erections in tests in which a stimulus female was present, but did not facilitate erections in tests in which she was absent. In sum, these experiments provide preliminary evidence that dopaminergic mechanisms may play a role in the regulation of male sexual behavior of rhesus monkeys.\n",
      "Yawning is a stereotyped event that occurs in humans and animals from fish to mammals, but neither its mechanisms nor its functions are entirely known. Its widespread nature suggests that it has important physiological functions. It is associated with stretching of muscles in a large area, but the function of this stretching is understood far from completely. It has been proposed that yawning increases arousal and that it is an arousal defense reflex, whose aim is to reverse brain hypoxia. Whilst yawning has been speculated to have an important role in reversing hypoxia, there is a structure in the neck that is known to be intimately involved in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, namely the carotid body. It senses acute changes in oxygen levels. In spite of this, a connection has never been proposed either between the carotid body and arousal, or between yawning and the carotid body. We propose that yawning stimulates mechanically the carotid body (and possibly other structures in the neck). We further propose that this stimulation gives rise to increased arousal, alertness and wakefulness and that one important physiological function of yawning is increase of arousal through this stimulation. We also propose that mechanical effects on the shunt system of the carotid body may be involved in this stimulation. Our hypothesis is supported by several facts. For example, yawning causes movements and compressions that may affect the carotid body that is situated strategically at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Thus, yawning may stimulate the carotid body. The carotid body is highly vascular and compressions may affect its shunt system and blood flow and for example give rise to release of hormones or other substances. Also several facts related to situations where people yawn or do not yawn support our hypothesis and are discussed. Further support comes from facts related to somnogenic substances, hormones and transmitters, and from facts related to the interconnection of homeostatic mechanisms, sleep, arousal and ventilation.\n",
      "Feeding conditions can impact sensitivity to drugs acting on dopamine receptors; less is known about the impact of feeding conditions on the effects of drugs acting on serotonin (5-HT) receptors. This study examined the effects of feeding conditions on sensitivity to the direct-acting 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOM; 0.1-3.2 mg/kg) and the direct-acting dopamine D3/D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg). Male Sprague-Dawley rats had free access (11 weeks), followed by restricted access (6 weeks), to high fat (34.3%, n=8) or standard (5.7% fat; n=7) chow. Rats eating high fat chow became insulin resistant and gained more weight than rats eating standard chow. Free access to high fat chow did not alter sensitivity to DOM-induced head twitch but increased sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning. Restricting access to high fat or standard chow shifted the DOM-induced head twitch dose-response curve to the right and shifted the quinpirole-induced yawning dose-response curve downward in both groups of rats. Some drugs of abuse and many therapeutic drugs act on 5-HT and dopamine systems; these results show that feeding conditions impact sensitivity to drugs acting on these systems, thereby possibly affecting vulnerability to abuse, as well as the therapeutic effectiveness of drugs.\n",
      "Eating high fat chow increases the sensitivity of male rats to some behavioral effects of the direct-acting dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole; it is not known whether sensitivity to quinpirole is similarly enhanced in female rats eating high fat chow. Female Sprague-Dawley rats had free access to standard chow (5.7% fat) or either free or restricted access (i.e. body weight matched to rats eating standard chow) to high fat (34.3% fat) chow. Quinpirole (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg) produced hypothermia and a low frequency of yawning. Eating high fat chow produced insulin resistance without affecting quinpirole-induced yawning or hypothermia. Pretreatment with the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist L-741,626 failed to increase quinpirole-induced yawning, indicating that the low frequency of yawning was not due to enhanced D2 receptor sensitivity. Compared with younger (postnatal day 75), drug-naive female rats in a previous study, rats in the present study (postnatal day 275) were more sensitive to cocaine-elicited (1-17.8 mg/kg) locomotion and the development of sensitization across 5 weeks; however, eating high fat chow did not further enhance these effects. These results suggest that drug history and age might modulate the effects of diet on sensitivity to drugs acting on dopamine systems.\n",
      "Central administration of oxytocin has been shown to induce yawning, penile erection, grooming and scratching. Yawning and penile erections are due to activation of oxytocinergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. We selectively bred two sublines from Sprague-Dawley rats, one with a high-yawning frequency (HY) of 20yawns/h, and one with a low-yawning (LY) frequency of 2yawns/h. The aim of the current study was to analyze the behavioral effects of centrally-administered oxytocin [15ng-10μg; intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)] on yawning, penile erections, grooming and scratching in adult male rats from both sublines. Oxytocin produced a dose-dependent increase in yawning and penile erection frequencies and this effect was significantly higher in the HY, compared to the LY, subline. However, the number of oxytocin-induced scratching bouts was significantly higher in the LY, compared to the HY group. In conclusion, these sublines represent a suitable model for detailed analysis of behavior induced by oxytocin and other neuropeptides in animals with different spontaneous expression of behavioral traits.\n",
      "Strain differences in spontaneous locomotor activity and the behavioral patterns induced by dopaminergic agonists in rodents can disclose differential genetic susceptibilities to dopaminergic dysfunction (i.e. vulnerability to psychosis). Psychogenetic selection of hypoemotional Roman High-Avoidance (RHA) and hyperemotional Low-Avoidance (RLA) rats leads to divergence in dopaminergic function as well. The present study was designed to characterize their spontaneous activity and their responses to apomorphine (0.067-3 mg/kg, s.c.) as compared to those of the standard Sprague-Dawley (SD) strain. The Roman strains displayed higher spontaneous activity than SD rats and RHA exhibited the higher response to novelty which agrees with a higher sensitivity to apomorphine in this strain. The biphasic effect induced by apomorphine (locomotor inhibition and yawning at low doses but stimulation of locomotion and stereotyped behavior at higher ones) was reproduced in the standard SD strain. Low doses were less effective inducing locomotor inhibition in RHA whereas these animals were much more sensitive to high dose-induced stereotyped behavior. In contrast, RLA was characterized as a high-yawning strain and low doses of apomorphine also induced a striking motor inhibition suggesting functional enhancement of dopamine receptors mediating these behaviors. The detailed and distinctive behavioral profiles described in this work suggest between strain differences both at the presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic function and may serve as paths to better specify functional mechanisms in future studies of risk of developing dopaminergic dysfunctions.\n"

      "The contagious aspect of yawning is a well-known phenomenon that exhibits variation in the human population. Despite the observed variation, few studies have addressed its intra-individual reliability or the factors modulating differences in the susceptibility of healthy volunteers. Due to its obvious biological basis and impairment in diseases like autism and schizophrenia, a better understanding of this trait could lead to novel insights into these conditions and the general biological functioning of humans. We administered 328 participants a 3-minute yawning video stimulus, a cognitive battery, and a comprehensive questionnaire that included measures of empathy, emotional contagion, circadian energy rhythms, and sleepiness. Individual contagious yawning measurements were found to be highly stable across testing sessions, both in a lab setting and if administered remotely online, confirming that certain healthy individuals are less susceptible to contagious yawns than are others. Additionally, most individuals who failed to contagiously yawn in our study were not simply suppressing their reaction, as they reported not even feeling like yawning in response to the stimulus. In contrast to previous studies indicating that empathy, time of day, or intelligence may influence contagious yawning susceptibility, we found no influence of these variables once accounting for the age of the participant. Participants were less likely to show contagious yawning as their age increased, even when restricting to ages of less than 40 years. However, age was only able to explain 8% of the variability in the contagious yawn response. The vast majority of the variability in this extremely stable trait remained unexplained, suggesting that studies of its inheritance are warranted.\n",

      "The dopamine (DA) D3 receptor (D3R) has been associated with impulsivity, pathologic gambling, and drug addiction, making it a potential target for pharmacotherapy development. Positron emission tomography studies using the D3R-preferring radioligand [(11)C]PHNO ([(11)C](+)-propyl-hexahydro-naphtho-oxazin) have shown higher binding potentials in drug abusers compared with control subjects. Preclinical studies have examined D3R receptor activation using the DA agonist quinpirole and the unconditioned behavior of yawning. However, the relationship between quinpirole-elicited yawning and D3R receptor availability has not been determined. In Experiment 1, eight drug-naive male rhesus monkeys were scanned with [(11)C]PHNO, and the ability of quinpirole (0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.m.) to elicit yawning was examined. Significant positive (globus pallidus) and negative (caudate nucleus, putamen, ventral pallidum, and hippocampus) relationships between D3R receptor availability and quinpirole-induced yawns were noted. Experiment 2 replicated earlier findings that a history of cocaine self-administration (n = 11) did not affect quinpirole-induced yawning and extended this to examine monkeys (n = 3) with a history of methamphetamine (MA) self-administration and found that monkeys with experience self-administering MA showed greater potency and significantly higher quinpirole-elicited yawning compared with controls. Finally, quinpirole-elicited yawning was studied in drug-naive female monkeys (n = 6) and compared with drug-naive male monkeys (n = 8). Sex differences were noted, with quinpirole being more potent and eliciting significantly more yawns in males compared with females. Taken together these findings support the use of quinpirole-elicited yawning as a behavioral tool for examining D3R activation in monkeys and that both drug history and sex may influence individual sensitivity to the behavioral effects of D3R compounds.\n",
      "Oxytocin (80 ng) induces yawning when injected into the caudal part of the ventral tegmental area, the hippocampal ventral subiculum and the posteromedial nucleus of the amygdala of male rats. The behavioural response occurred concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of extracellular dopamine and its main metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the dialysate obtained from the shell of the nucleus accumbens and of the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex by means of intracerebral microdialysis. Both oxytocin responses were significantly reduced by d(CH₂)₅Tyr(Me)²-Orn⁸-vasotocin, a selective oxytocin receptor antagonist, injected in the above brain areas 15 min before oxytocin. Similar results were obtained by activating central oxytocinergic neurons originating in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and projecting to the ventral tegmental area, the hippocampus and the amygdala, with the dopamine agonist apomorphine given at a dose that induces yawning when injected into the paraventricular nucleus. Since oxytocin is considered a key regulator of emotional and social reward that enhances amygdala-dependent, socially reinforced learning and emotional empathy, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurons play a key role in motivation and reward, and yawning in mammals is considered a primitive, unconscious form of empathy, the present results support the hypothesis that oxytocinergic neurons originating in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and projecting to the above brain areas and mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neurons participate in the complex neural circuits that play a role in the above mentioned functions.\n",

      "Rationale: Increases in dopamine D2-like receptor function are common in several psychological disorders that demonstrate a four to five fold increase in nicotine abuse compared to the general population.\n",
      "Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of sex differences and sensitization to nicotine in rats D2 receptor primed as neonates.\n",
      "Materials and methods: A total of 32 male and 32 female Sprague-Dawley rats derived from eight litters were ontogenetically treated with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline from postnatal days (P) 1-21 and raised to adulthood. At P60, all animals were given an acute injection of quinpirole HCl (100 microg/kg) and yawns were counted for 1 h. Yawning has been shown to be a behavioral event mediated by D2-like receptors. Beginning on P61-65, animals were habituated to a locomotor arena and subsequently administered either nicotine (0.5 mg/kg free base) or saline (intraperitoneal) every second day for 3 weeks. Approximately 15 min after each injection, animals were placed into the arena and horizontal activity and vertical rears were recorded.\n",
      "Results: A robust increase of yawning was observed at P60 in D2 primed as compared to saline controls. Priming of D2-like receptors increased the locomotor response to nicotine in horizontal activity in both males and females, but females demonstrated a more robust hypoactive locomotor response to initial nicotine treatment when compared to saline-treated females. Nicotine also produced a significant decrease of vertical rearing in both males and females.\n",
      "Conclusions: It appears that D2 receptor priming enhances sensitization to nicotine in adult rats, and females may be more behaviorally sensitive to nicotine than males.\n",

      "Quinelorane, a highly selective D2 dopamine agonist, was assessed for its ability to induce the penile erection/stretch-yawn syndrome. Quinelorane (0.1-100 micrograms/kg s.c.) or saline vehicle was administered to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats just prior to a 30 min. observation period. Significant dose-related increases in erections were observed in the drug treated animals at 3-100 micrograms/kg. Yawning was also increased at 3-100 micrograms/kg, with highest levels occurring at 10 micrograms/kg. Defecation was stimulated between 10 and 100 micrograms/kg. The stimulatory effects of 30 micrograms/kg of quinelorane on erection, yawning and defecation were blocked by haloperidol (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) but not by domperidone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg). No significant effects of quinelorane on seminal emission were observed. These findings indicate that in addition to its stimulatory effects on sexual activity, quinelorane also acts on D2 receptors in the central nervous system to stimulate erection in the penile erection/stretch-yawn model.\n"

      "We used SKF 38393 and quinpirole for determining whether activation of D(1) and D(2) receptors, respectively, is involved in behaviors of rats selectively bred for high or low rates of yawning. After injection of SKF 38393, yawning diminished more markedly in high-yawning (HY) than in low-yawning (LY) rats, whereas this drug increased the number and duration of grooming episodes similarly in both strains. After injection of quinpirole, yawning increased more markedly in HY than in LY rats, whereas this drug decreased the number and duration of grooming episodes similarly in both rat strains. After coadministration of SKF 38393 and quinpirole, yawning increased similarly in both rat strains, whereas the combination of drugs failed to reliably affect grooming behavior. We interpret our findings as indicating that D(2) receptors are more important than D(1) receptors for differences in yawning behavior between HY and LY rats.\n",
      "We previously reported that intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist attenuates the arousal response during yawning behavior in rats. However, the CRF-related pathway involved in the arousal response during yawning is still unclear. In the present study, we assessed the involvement of the CRF-containing pathway from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the locus coeruleus (LC) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the arousal response during frequent spontaneous yawning, which was induced by several microinjections of l-glutamate into the PVN in anesthetized rats, using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. The PVN stimulation showed significant increases in activation of PVN CRF neurons, LC noradrenalin (NA) neurons and DRN serotonin (5-HT) neurons as well as arousal response during yawning. But icv administration of a CRF receptor antagonist, α-helical CRF (9-41), significantly inhibited the activation of both LC NA neurons and DRN 5-HT neurons except the activation of CRF neurons in the PVN, and significantly suppressed the arousal response during yawning. These results suggest that the CRF-containing pathway from PVN CRF neurons to LC NA neurons and DRN 5-HT neurons can be involved in the arousal response during yawning behavior.\n",
      "Effects of stress on drug-induced yawning: Constant vs. intermittent stress. PHYSIOL BEHAV 58(1) 181-184, 1995.--Experiment 1 tested whether chronic exposure to immobilization, foot shock or forced swimming would result in suppression of apomorphine-, pilocarpine-, and physostigmine-induced yawning. Immobilization caused suppression of yawning, whereas foot shock and swimming resulted in increased number of yawns. Since interstressor interval was long in the two latter stressors, animals could have recovered and the increase in yawning could be due to the last (acute) exposure to stress. In Experiment 2 we recorded the number of yawns induced by pilocarpine in animals exposed to 1 h of swimming or foot shock. No differences between control and acutely stressed animals were detected. These results suggest that yawning is differently altered by constant and intermittent stressors (i.e., diminished by constant and increased by intermittent stress).\n",
      "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 14 migraineous outpatients and 8 control subjects to assess yawning response to 0.25 mg of sublingual apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, by means of an audiovisual technique. Apomorphine induced a significantly higher number of yawns than placebo in both groups of subjects, but the effect was significantly greater in migraine sufferers than in controls. The result seems to confirm the previous reported hyper-responsiveness to pharmacological dopaminergic stimulation in migraine sufferers. Moreover, the audiovisual technique seems to be an appropriate tool to study yawning response in man.\n",
      "Yawning, associated with genital grooming, is a physiological response that may be used for elucidating the mechanism of action of drugs. Preliminary analysis showed that aqueous extract (AE) of Saccharum induced yawns in rats. So, we aimed to quantify these behavioral responses and investigate the pharmacological mechanisms involved in these actions. During 120 min, after AE administration, the yawns and the genital grooming were quantified at 10 min intervals. Since dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways are implied in these responses, AE were evaluated in the presence of haloperidol 0.5 mg/kg and atropine 2 mg/kg. AE 0.5 g/kg increased the yawns, effect that was blocked both by haloperidol and atropine. Genital grooming could only be stimulated by AE 0.5 g/kg when dopaminergic receptors were blocked by haloperidol. However, it was inhibited when atropine was previously administered. So, we demonstrated a central action of Saccharum and it was postulated that neural circuits with the participation of dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways are involved. The fact that AE is comprised of innumerous compounds could justify the extract's distinct responses. Also, we cannot disregard the presence of different neural circuits that count on the participation of dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways and could be activated by the same induction agent.\n",
      "Although yawning occurs frequently during the IV induction of general anesthesia, the significance of this response remains unknown. In this study, we induced 30 surgical patients with 4 mg/kg thiopental IV, and 30 patients with 2 mg/kg propofol IV. Thereafter, the occurrence of yawning was continuously assessed, as the only clinical end-point, for 1 min. The electroencephalographic bispectral index was monitored throughout the observation period. The criterion for an arousal response was a transient increase during a continuing decrease in the bispectral index value. On the basis of this criterion, the sensitivity and specificity of the yawning response as an arousal sign were 77% and 80%, respectively. If a patient exhibited a yawning response, the chance of arousal was 84% (positive predictive value). With no yawning response, the chance of nonarousal was 71% (negative predictive value). According to simple logistic regression, the yawning response was predictive of a transient arousal-shift with an odds ratio of 13.5 (95% confidence interval: 3.8-48; P < 0.001). The occurrence of a yawning response during IV induction may be a clinical indicator of a transient arousal-shift during progressive loss of consciousness.\n",
      "Implications: Yawning elicited by IV anesthetic induction was related to a transient increase during the continuing decrease in the electroencephalographic bispectral index value (sensitivity and specificity, 77% and 80%, respectively). This type of yawning may be a clinical indicator of a transient arousal-shift during progressive loss of consciousness.\n",
      "Nutritional status can impact dopamine systems in a manner that might be important to understanding possible common neurobiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal compulsive food (e.g., obesity) and drug taking. Limiting food intake, for example, can increase sensitivity to the behavioral effects of indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonists. Much less is known regarding possible diet-induced changes in sensitivity to direct-acting dopamine receptor drugs. The present study investigated the effects of a high fat diet and of food restriction on sensitivity of rats to the behavioral effects of a direct-acting dopamine receptor agonist and a dopamine receptor antagonist. Free access to high fat chow increased sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning without changing sensitivity to raclopride-induced catalepsy or quinpirole-induced hypothermia. Food restriction (10 g/day) decreased sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning and raclopride-induced catalepsy without affecting sensitivity to quinpirole-induced hypothermia. Free access to a standard chow restored sensitivity to the behavioral effects of both drugs in rats that were previously food-restricted but not in rats that previously ate a high fat diet. These data confirm that food restriction can decrease sensitivity to behavioral effects of direct-acting dopamine receptor drugs, they provide evidence (i.e., no change in hypothermic effects) indicating that these changes are not due to pharmacokinetic mechanisms, and they provide initial evidence showing enhanced sensitivity to behavioral effects of dopamine receptor drugs in rats eating a high fat diet. These changes in sensitivity of dopamine systems could be relevant to understanding the impact of nutrition on therapeutic and recreational drug use.\n"

      "A wide range of doses of d-amphetamine and apomorphine were injected into rats, in order to better characterize and compare dopaminergic agonist-induced behavioral effects. The study was carried out using a computerized technique for the quantification and analysis of various behavioral elements. Although both drugs increased motor activity and provided dose-dependent stereotyped responses, the whole pattern of behavior in the open field showed a different structure. d-Amphetamine in doses that did not produce stereotyped responses induced a wide range of varied behavioral elements with increased frequency but decreased mean duration, while apomorphine induced a more restricted behavioral profile. Furthermore, a higher frequency of freezing reaction was observed after d-amphetamine treatment in low doses but not after apomorphine treatment. Both drugs in high doses elicited a similar stereotyped syndrome characterized by repetitive movements of great duration, but at low doses the behavioral pattern was completely different. The apomorphine-induced syndrome was characterized mainly by moving and sniffing, interrupted by rearing, while the amphetamine-induced syndrome by sniffing and moving, interrupted by standing and freezing.\n",

Urate levels were slightly but nonsignificantly higher in Schirmer strip samples (P > 0.05).\n",
      "Conclusions: The conflict in published data on tear antioxidants is caused by differences in collection methods. With the exception of urate, antioxidants accumulate to very high levels in corneal cells. Spuriously high antioxidant levels in tears collected using Schirmer strips, therefore, are most probably caused by contamination with intracellular constituents. The capillary tube collection method is proposed as the method of choice for reflex tear collection for biochemical studies. This less-invasive method facilitates the evaluation of tear antioxidant levels as a biomonitoring tool for corneal health. Although moderately increased antioxidant levels may be beneficial, the authors hypothesize that marked increases may indicate damage to the ocular surface.\n",
      "Accompanying physiological changes may clarify the functions of yawning, an act that is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. The skin conductance, muscle tension, and heart rate of 30 young adult humans were recorded before, during, and after their yawns. These measures were also taken in 20 control subjects who merely opened their mouths or took deep breaths. Yawning, mouth opening and deep breathing each increased arousal initially, as measured by skin conductance. Some cumulative effects of successive yawns were found.\n",
      "It has long been known that the intracerebroventricular administration of ACTH1-24 increases the duration of grooming episodes and the frequency of yawning in rats. The objective of this study was to investigate in what way these episodes are prolonged and whether and to what extent genotype influences such effects. We compared the effect of increasing doses of intracerebroventricular injections of ACTH1-24 on grooming and yawning in males of two inbred strains of Sprague-Dawley rats with distinct yawning frequency, high-yawning (HY) and low-yawning (LY). In LY rats the duration of grooming episodes increased, while in HY rats grooming episodes augmented both in number and duration. In LY rats the duration of grooming components increased likewise, in HY rats however, neither the number nor the duration of the components changed. The grooming rate in both strains of rats was slowed, though more so in LY than in HY rats. Yawning increased in LY rats but not in HY rats. We conclude therefore that ACTH1-24 increases the duration of grooming episodes by slowing the grooming rate according to genotype, and may or may not alter the frequency of yawning.\n",
      "The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of oxytocin, in doses ranging from 5 to 90 ng (5-90 pmol) induced penile erection and yawning in male rats. Such response was not induced by doses of the peptide higher than 100 ng, nor by equimolar doses of i.c.v. [Arg8]vasopressin, ACTH-(1-24), alpha-MSH, rat corticotropin-releasing factor (rCRF), delta sleep-inducing peptide, neurotensin or substance P. Oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning were prevented by atropine and morphine, but not by methylatropine or the opiate antagonist naloxone. Haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, was ineffective at low doses; it partially prevented penile erection but not yawning at high doses. Since oxytocin is present not only in the neurohypophysis but also in other brain areas, our results suggest that oxytocin is implicated in the regulation of penile erection and yawning, and provide further evidence that oxytocin acts as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system.\n",
      "This study was carried out aiming to reach behavioral and neuropharmacological evidence of the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to serotonin systemically administered in quails. Serotonin injected by a parenteral route (250-1000 microg x kg(-1), sc) elicited a sequence of behavioral events concerned with a sleeping-like state. Sleeping-like behaviors began with feather bristling, rapid oral movements, blinking and finally crouching and closure of the eyes. Previous administration of 5-HT2C antagonist, LY53857 (3 mg x kg(-1), sc) reduced the episodes of feather bristling and rapid oral movements significantly but without altering the frequency of blinking and closure of the eyes. Treatment with the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist, ketanserin (3 mg x kg(-1), sc) did not affect any of the responses evoked by the serotonin. Quipazine (5 mg x kg(-1), sc) a 5-HT2A/2C/3 agonist induced intense hypomotility, long periods of yawning-like and sleeping-like states. Previous ketanserin suppressed gaping responses and reduced hypomotility, rapid oral movements and bristling but was ineffective for remaining responses induced by quipazine. Results showed that unlike mammals, serotonin permeates the BBB and activates hypnogenic mechanisms in quails. Studies using serotoninergic agonist and antagonists have disclosed that among the actions of the serotonin, feather bristling, rapid oral movements and yawning-like state originated from activation of 5-HT2 receptors while blinking and closure of the eyes possibly require other subtypes of receptors.\n",

      "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the dominance history of socially housed Java-monkeys on the aging process. In monkeys, social subordinance is generally associated with elevated levels of cortisol, which, in turn, have been suggested to influence cognitive decline. As cognitive skills are necessary for successful social life, we investigated the effect of old age in relation to the dominance history of the animals on their social behavior by comparing old females with their younger daughters. Old age, especially in combination with a history of low rank, led to a withdrawal from social interactions with unfamiliar animals and to a decrease in amounts of aggression received. Still, however, old animals showed an increase in behaviors associated with arousal. A reduced ability to deal with complex social interactions, caused by a decline in information processing abilities, is suggested as an explanation for these results.\n"

      "The effect of chronic lithium pretreatment on physostigmine-induced yawning was investigated in male rats. Intraperitoneal administration of physostigmine to rats induced yawning in a biphasic manner. However the maximum response was obtained by 0.2 mg/kg of the drug. Intracerebroventricular administrations of a putative M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor antagonists, pirenzepine and methoctramine decreased physostigmine-induced yawning. Intraperitoneal administration of a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, also decreased the physostigmine-induced yawning significantly. Chronic lithium pretreatment (30 days) reduced yawning induced by physostigmine. The inhibitory effect of pirenzepine, methoctramine and atropine on physostigmine-induced yawning increased in rats pretreated with chronic lithium. These findings indicate that yawning is induced by a central cholinergic mechanism and that chronic pretreatment of lithium may interact with the cholinergic-induced behaviour.\n",
      "The authors studied grooming and yawning caused by mild stress in laboratory Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus). Two groups received 3 and 6 sequences of 5 foot shocks at random intervals (RI) and fixed intervals (FI), respectively. A 3rd group was not shocked (NS). The groups were exposed for 60 min twice. Grooming did not differ among groups, but yawning diminished with RI. Yawning increased and grooming decreased with the 2nd exposure, except in RI in which grooming increased. In NS and FI, grooming prevailed during the first 20 and 30 min, respectively, whereas yawning dominated the remainder of the time. In RI, grooming occurred more than yawning. An upward shift on this scale causes grooming to substitute yawning, whereas a downward shift causes the reverse effect.\n",
      "Ongoing debate in the literature concerns whether there is a link between contagious yawning and the human mirror neuron system (hMNS). One way of examining this issue is with the use of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure changes in mu activation during the observation of yawns. Mu oscillations are seen in the alpha bandwidth of the EEG (8-12 Hz) over sensorimotor areas. Previous work has shown that mu suppression is a useful index of hMNS activation and is sensitive to individual differences in empathy. In two experiments, we presented participants with videos of either people yawning or control stimuli. We found greater mu suppression for yawns than for controls over right motor and premotor areas, particularly for those scoring higher on traits of empathy. In a third experiment, auditory recordings of yawns were compared against electronically scrambled versions of the same yawns. We observed greater mu suppression for yawns than for the controls over right lateral premotor areas. Again, these findings were driven by those scoring highly on empathy. The results from these experiments support the notion that the hMNS is involved in contagious yawning, emphasise the link between contagious yawning and empathy, and stress the importance of good control stimuli.\n",
      "Anterior, superior and posterior auricular muscles were studied electromyographically by means of wire electrodes. During ear movement the three muscles acted as a group and the movement was always directed upwards and backwards. The highest electrical activities were observed during natural smiling and yawning. Mouth opening without the drawing backwards of the comissura labiorum and the displacement of galea aponeurotica also produced electrical activity by the auricular muscles, with however, less intensity and in only 50% of the cases studied.\n",

      "Microinjection of oxytocin into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus or into the CA1 field of the hippocampus induced a dose-dependent increase in the number of penile erection and yawning episodes in male rats. The minimal effective dose of oxytocin injected into the paraventricular nucleus was 3 ng. This dose induced the above-mentioned behaviors in 60% of the treated rats. Doses of 9 ng or higher induced the symptomatology in more than 85% of the animals. On the other hand, when the peptide was injected into the CA1 field of the hippocampus, 9 ng bilaterally were necessary to elicit penile erection and yawning in 62% of the rats. Arg8-vasopressin, which only differs from oxytocin in two amino acids, induced penile erection and yawning when injected either into the paraventricular nucleus or into the hippocampus, but was 5-10 times less potent than oxytocin. Oxytocin injection into the lateral septum, caudate nucleus, subiculum, preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, was ineffective. The powerful effect of oxytocin on the induction of yawning and penile erection, suggests a physiological role of hypothalamic and hippocampal oxytocin in the regulation of such responses.\n",
      "Interactions between the direct (unconditioned) behavioural effects apomorphine and its conditioned effects after pairing with previously neutral stimuli were studied. Rats were injected once daily for 3-12 times, with apomorphine (2.0 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg or 0.07 mg/kg s.c. the dose kept constant in each series), in the presence of defined environmental stimuli (a wire cage in association with an acoustic and an olfactory stimulus) as conditional stimuli. The two larger doses produced stereotyped sniffing, licking, and gnawing, the smallest dose akinesia, ptosis, yawning and penile erections. During the conditioning phase, the drug produced most of the effects with increasing intensity and in the case of the stereotypies, there also was a shift to higher scores of stereotypy, with a reduced latency in onset of the signs. On the test day, 1 day after the last administration of apomorphine, the conditioned rats as well as \"pseudoconditioned\" controls were treated with a test dose of apomorphine in the presence of the conditional stimuli. Pseudoconditioned rats had been treated with the same pharmacological schedule of apomorphine and had the same familiarity with the stimuli, but both were kept separate. A test dose of 0.5 mg/kg of apomorphine produced stereotypies with a significantly higher score and shorter latency in onset in conditioned than in pseudoconditioned rats. Rats conditioned with the lowest dose showed a significantly longer total duration and a shorter latency in onset of akinesia and ptosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "The subtype of dopamine (DA) receptors mediating the yawning response to DA agonists was determined in rats. Yawning was elicited both by the mixed D1-D2 agonist apomorphine and by the specific D2 agonist LY 171555, but not by the selective D1 agonist SKF 38393. Both apomorphine- and LY 171555-induced yawning were antagonized not only by the selective D2 antagonist sulpiride but, unexpectedly, also by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390. The results suggest that DA receptors mediating the yawning response are of the D2 type, and that these receptors are connected with D1 receptors in such a way that the blockade of the latter results in the functional inactivation of the former.\n",
      "The effect of verapamil, flunarizine, nimodipine, nicardipine, and nifedipine, calcium channel inhibitors, and of indomethacin and aspirin, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, on penile erection and yawning induced by oxytocin was studied in male rats. All calcium channel inhibitors given intraperitoneally (IP) 60 min before the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of oxytocin (30 ng) prevented in a dose-dependent manner oxytocin effect. Nimodipine and nicardipine were the most effective being active at doses between 5 and 20 mg/kg, while the others were active at doses higher than 15 mg/kg. Prevention of oxytocin effect was also seen after ICV injection of the above compounds. Unlike calcium channel inhibitors, indomethacin given either IP (10 and 50 mg/kg) or ICV (50 micrograms), or aspirin (100 mg/kg IP) were ineffective. Microinjection of calcium, but not of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the brain area most sensitive for the induction of the above behavioral responses by oxytocin, induced a symptomatology similar to that induced by oxytocin. The present results suggest that calcium might be the second messenger which mediates the expression of penile erection and yawning induced by oxytocin.\n"

      "Penile erection and yawning induced by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of oxytocin (10-1000 ng) was studied in hypophysectomized rats and in rats neonatally treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a treatment that depletes hypothalamic opiomelanocorticotropin-derived peptides without altering their pituitary and circulating concentration. Oxytocin effect was strongly reduced by hypophysectomy, but not by neonatal MSG. Testosterone replacement (50 micrograms/kg/day for 23 days) partially reversed the effect of hypophysectomy on penile erection, but not on yawning. The present results suggest that oxytocin does not induce penile erection and yawning by releasing an ACTH-derived peptide from hypothalamic opiomelanotropinergic neurons, and that the pituitary gland exerts a permissive role on the expression of the above behavioural responses induced by oxytocin.\n",
      "Background: This report details the case histories of two women who suffer from chronic and debilitating episodes of excessive yawning in the absence of sleep problems.\n",
      "Methods: Each woman independently provided information and answered questions about their excessive yawning symptoms and medical histories.\n",
      "Results: Both women show signs of thermoregulatory dysfunction, and each reports symptom relief and/or the postponement of yawning attacks through means of behavioral cooling. One woman recorded her body temperature before and after bouts of yawning, revealing a significant drop in temperature following each episode (p < 0.05).\n",
      "Conclusions: The trigger for yawning in these patients appears to be related to increases in body/brain temperature. These cases are consistent with growing evidence showing that recurrent episodes of excessive yawning are not necessarily associated with a sleep disorder, but rather may be indicative of thermoregulatory dysfunction.\n",

      "Two cases of brain stem stroke involving the upper pons and the ponto-mesencephalic junction presented with transient excessive pathological yawning, associated with gait ataxia and in one subject with upper limb and facial hemiparesis. A causal relation is hypothesised between the brain stem lesion and pathological yawning, possibly related to denervation hypersensitivity of a putative brain stem yawn centre. Excessive yawning may herald brain stem ischaemia.\n",
      "Yawning has been rarely described in association with seizures and not previously documented by video-EEG. We present a 48-year-old woman with a long history of non-dominant for speech hemisphere seizures and post-ictal yawning. Yawning was irresistible, forceful and often repetitive. We reviewed the few similar epileptic cases described in the literature and discussed the possible mechanisms. [Published with video sequences].\n",
      "We measured dorsal hippocampal activity accompanying sighs and apnea using reflectance imaging and electrophysiologic measures in freely behaving cats. Reflected 660-nm light from a 1-mm2 area of CA1 was captured during sighs and apnea at 25 Hz through a coherent image conduit coupled to a charge coupled device camera. Sighs and apnea frequently coincided with state transitions. Thus, state transitions without apnea or sighs were separately assessed to control for state-related activity changes. All dorsal hippocampal sites showed discrete regions of activation and inactivation during transient respiratory events. Imaged hippocampal activity increased 1-3 s before the enhanced inspiratory effort associated with sighs, and before resumption of breathing after apnea. State transitions lacking sighs and apnea did not elicit analogous optical activity patterns. The suprasylvian cortex, a control for site, showed no significant overall reflectance changes during phasic respiratory events, and no discrete regions of activation or inactivation. Spectral estimates of hippocampal electroencephalographic activity from 0-12 Hz showed significantly increased power at 3-4 Hz rhythmical slow activity before sighs and apnea, and increased 5-6 Hz rhythmical slow activity power during apnea, before resumption of breathing. Imaged activity and broadband hippocampal electroencephalogram power decreased during sighs. We propose that increased hippocampal activity before sigh onset and apnea termination indicates a role for the hippocampus in initiating inspiratory effort during transient respiratory events.\n",
      "Objective: To study yawning activity in healthy fetuses and in fetuses at high risk.\n",
      "Methods: Yawning activity was studied in 16 healthy and 22 high-risk fetuses. Studies were performed in the postprandial state at 09.00 and 12.00 in a quiet room with the woman in the lateral recumbent position. All ultrasound examinations were performed using a 3.5-MHz Acuson 128 PX curvilinear probe. Fetal lips, mouth, tongue, pharynx, larynx, trachea and esophagus were surveyed in serial coronal and sagittal planes. All fetal mouthing movements were analyzed by a review of the videotape in slow motion.\n",
      "Results: In both normal and high-risk fetuses, yawning was represented by isolated mouthing movements and consisted of slow opening of the mouth with simultaneous downward movements of the tongue. This phase occupied 50-75% of the yawning cycle. After reaching its maximum opening, the mouth remained wide open for 2-8 s and returned to its resting position within seconds. Growth-restricted fetuses demonstrated yawning patterns consisting of isolated yawns similar to those seen in healthy fetuses. Unusual bursts of fetal yawning activity were recorded in anemic fetuses.\n",
      "Conclusion: Yawning activity in anemic fetuses may represent a compensatory process to increase venous return to the heart.\n",
      "Oxytocin (10 and 30 ng) injected into a lateral ventricle (i.c.v.) or the dopamine agonist apomorphine (40 and 80 micrograms/kg) injected subcutaneously induced repeated episodes of penile erection and yawning in male rats. The concomitant administration of the two substances did not produce any further increase in the number of penile erection and yawning episodes. Penile erection and yawning induced by either oxytocin or apomorphine were antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by i.c.v. pretreatment with the oxytocin antagonists [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8]vasotocin, [Pen1,Phe(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8]oxytocin and [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Arg8]vasopressin, with a rank order of potency that follows their antioxytocic activity. (i.e. [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8]vasotocin congruent to [Pen1,Phe(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin greater than [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Arg8]vasopressin). The results suggest that apomorphine induces penile erection and yawning by releasing oxytocin in the central nervous system.\n",
      "Yawning is a complex event that depends largely on the autonomic nervous system. Microneurographic techniques were used to study the mechanism involved in yawning. A series of spontaneous yawns displayed by a healthy 39-year-old male offered us the opportunity to study the muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) during this phenomenon. It was found that 2 s of yawning inhibited the MSNA recorded at the right peroneal nerve in the lateral knee area, while 3 s of slow expiration succeeding a yawn provoked an MSNA discharge. Blood pressure decreased with each slow expiration by 5-6 mmHg, and increased again with the renewed MSNA discharge. We conclude that yawning is associated with a sympathetic suppression that favours a parasympathetic dominance, as indicated by the MSNA and the decrease in blood pressure. The slow expiration following a yawn is associated with a sympathetic activation marked by an MSNA discharge and an increase in blood pressure.\n",
      "A comparative study of the effect of pilocarpine, a muscarinic receptor agonist, on grooming, scored during 45 min via a time-sampling procedure, was carried out on two sublines of male rats selectively bred for high-(HY) and low-yawning (LY) frequency. In one condition, we introduced rats in a novel cage and observed them immediately after receiving an I.P. injection of pilocarpine (0.5-3.75 mg/Kg) or an equivalent volume of saline. Besides grooming, the occurrence of yawns was continuously recorded. In the other condition, we immersed rats in water for 60 s, then they received an I.P. injection of pilocarpine (3.75 mg/Kg) or an equivalent volume of saline and we placed them in an open field, in which we recorded the number of crossed squares. Grooming scores were significantly higher in the condition after water immersion than in the novel situation; in both conditions HY had a grooming response higher than that of LY rats. Pilocarpine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of novelty-induced grooming in HY rats, whereas LY grooming was reduced only with the highest dose. In contrast, yawning increased in a dose-dependent manner with HY rats curve over that of LY animals, except for the highest dose. Pilocarpine inhibited water immersion-induced grooming in both sublines of rats, but it did not reduce grooming as much as it did in the novel condition. Pilocarpine affected distinctly each of the components of grooming, without inhibiting animals locomotor activity. The results indicate that HY rats also have a higher number of grooms than LY rats, and because grooming and yawning can appear after stressful circumstances, HY rats may be used to study the role that both behaviors could have in counteracting the effects of stress. Similarly, HY animals might be utilized to study the underlying neurochemical mechanisms of grooming. This study also indicates that the cholinergic systems exert an inhibitory influence on grooming which contrasts with the excitatory effect on yawning.\n"

      "It is well established that denervation of the dorsal striatum by its dopaminergic afferents attenuates the stereotyped response to d-amphetamine, which can be considered as an extreme form of motor activation. However, it is difficult to sustain the view that this structure serves primary motor control function because the role of dopamine in the striatum remains difficult to understand. In this study, we compared the effects of two dopaminergic agonists, d-amphetamine and apomorphine, after dorsal striatal lesions with ibotenic acid using a computerized scoring of the behavior. Although d-amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced locomotor activity was no different between lesioned and nonlesioned rats in photobeam activity cages, the structure of their behavioral pattern was quite different. Freezing, a usual response after d-amphetamine, was blocked by the lesion. Lesioned rats exhibited less standing than nonlesioned after d-amphetamine, apomorphine, or saline treatment. Moving was increased in lesioned rats after a low dose of d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) or apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg), while d-amphetamine induced in the same rats an increase of rearing. Stereotyped behavior after both drugs at high doses was not affected by striatal lesion. These results indicate that the dorsal striatum is not involved only in the control of stereotypy, as has been suggested using 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, but also plays a major role in the mediation of behavioral activation in response to stimulant drugs.\n",
      "Yawning is a reflex or event that is not fully understood. It is controlled by many neurotransmitters and neuropeptides and can be induced pharmacologically by cholinergic or dopaminergic agonists. Amongst their many actions, cannabinoids acting on cannabinoid (CB(1) or CB(2)) receptors can alter cholinergic and/or dopaminergic activity. This study examined the effects of Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(8)-THC) administered acutely (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally [ip], 15 min before test) or chronically (5 mg/kg for 30 days followed by 24 h or 7 days of discontinuation) on yawning induced by pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist (0, 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg ip), or apomorphine, a dopaminergic agonist (0, 20, 40 or 80 microg/kg subcutaneously [sc]). Acute effects of different doses of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC: 0, 0.5, 1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg ip) on yawning induced by pilocarpine (2 mg/kg ip) or apomorphine (40 microg/kg sc) were also investigated. Both pilocarpine and apomorphine produced yawning in a dose-related manner. Acute administration of Delta(8)-THC and Delta(9)-THC significantly reduced yawning induced by both pilocarpine and apomorphine. Chronic administration of Delta(8)-THC did not change yawning induced by either agonist 24 h or 7 days after discontinuation of Delta(8)-THC. However, a high frequency of spontaneous yawning was observed 7 days after Delta(8)-THC discontinuation. These results suggest that cannabinoid agonists inhibited yawning induced by cholinergic or dopaminergic agonists. In addition, the increased frequency of spontaneous yawning following cessation of chronic administration of a cannabinoid agonist may be of importance as a withdrawal sign for these drugs.\n",
      "Low doses of the dopamine D2-receptor agonist, B-HT 920 (25 micrograms/kg, SC), and the dopamine D1/D2-receptor agonists, apomorphine (50 micrograms/kg, SC) and piribedil (1 mg/kg, SC), evoked yawning. However, the dopamine D1-receptor agonist, SK&F 38393 (2 mg/kg, SC), failed to induce yawning. The yawning responses induced by B-HT 920, apomorphine or piribedil were markedly increased without eliciting stereotypy by pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg, IP, 24 hr). These yawning responses were also enhanced by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) (300 mg/kg, IP, 72 hr), but not by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (300 mg/kg, IP, 6 hr). The yawning induced by B-HT 920 given alone and in combination with reserpine or PCPA was inhibited by spiperone (0.5 mg/kg, IP) or scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, IP), but not by SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg, IP). The present results suggest that yawning is evoked by stimulation of dopamine D2-receptors having a high affinity and consequent muscarinic activation, and that the yawning induced by dopamine receptor agonists is potentiated by decreases in serotonergic neuron activity.\n",
      "The effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of omega-conotoxin GVIA on penile erection and yawning induced by oxytocin or by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine was studied in male rats. The peptide toxin, 1-10 ng given ICV 5 min before oxytocin (30 ng ICV) or apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg SC), but not its carboxymethylated (CM) derivative, prevented the above behavioral responses in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, omega-conotoxin (5 ng) unilaterally injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) prevented penile erection and yawning induced by the microinjection of oxytocin (10 ng) or apomorphine (50 ng) in the PVN. omega-Conotoxin injected in the PVN, but not in the preoptic area, prevented also penile erection and yawning induced by systemic apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg SC). ICV omega-conotoxin was unable to prevent stereotypy induced by apomorphine (500 micrograms/kg SC). The present results provide further evidence that calcium plays a major role in the expression of penile erection and yawning and that apomorphine and oxytocin induce these behavioral responses by mobilizing calcium through omega-conotoxin-sensitive (N-type) calcium channels.\n",
      "To better characterize the neuroleptic-like properties of neurotensin, the dose-related effects of the peptide on the following behavioral phenomena were examined: a) the yawning-penile erection syndrome induced by small doses of the dopamine agonists apomorphine and N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA); b) yawning produced by the anticholinesterase physostigmine, and c) stereotyped climbing and sniffing produced by a larger dose of apomorphine. Several doses of the peptide were injected intraventricularly 30 min prior to drug administration. Results indicate that neurotensin markedly decreased yawning and penile erections produced by both apomorphine and NPA. These effects were seen with relatively small doses (0.9-3.75 micrograms). Neurotensin also potently decreased physostigmine-induced yawning with the initial inhibitory effect seen with 50 ng of the peptide. Apomorphine-induced climbing was significantly attenuated with 30.0 and 60.0 micrograms neurotensin, whereas stereotyped sniffing was unaffected, even by doses as large as 120.0 micrograms. These findings suggest that neurotensin might antagonize dopamine autoreceptors and indicate that the peptide possess central anticholinergic activity. Furthermore, these results lend support to the hypothesis that neurotensin's profile of central actions resemble that of atypical neuroleptics.\n",
      "\"Cardiac and respiratory oscillations have been shown to interact with each other. This interaction could reflect autonomic nervous system functionality. Propofol-induced yawning during anesthesia induction seems to be associated with sympathetic activation. Presumptively, there is high linearity among interaction of different physiologic system behaviors. Recently, investigators used coherence analysis to quantify the existence and strength of linearity between system signals for study of cardio-respiratory interaction under different physiological conditions. In this investigation, we used a method of time-frequency coherence function to analyze ECG and respiration signals to investigate the linearity of cardio-respiratory dynamics in patients undergoing routine propofol induction procedures for elective surgery. In this prospective, observational clinical study, a total of 84 eligible patients were enrolled. The patients were categorized into yawning and no-yawning groups during propofol induction. During induction, both groups demonstrated significant reduction in high frequency coherence (coh-HF) with simultaneously significant increase in very low frequency coherence (coh-VLF) compared to the pre-induction period. As yawning occurred, the yawning group had more significant changes of cardio-respiratory coherences than the no-yawning group at coh-LF and coh-VLF bands. The yawning group also showed loss of linearity at high frequency band (coh-HF > 0.5) as compared with the pre-induction period, and also showed increases in linearity at low (coh-LF > 0.5) and very low (coh-VLF > 0.5) frequency bands compared with the no-yawning group. Propofol-induced yawning alters cardio-respiratory dynamics with changes of linearity between cardio-vascular and respiratory system behaviors.\"\n"

      "The dependence of erectile behavior on androgen functioning is well established. Castration produces loss of both libido and potency in man and animals. The present study, using an animal model for potency, demonstrates the dependence of centrally induced erectile behavior on an intact androgen milieu. Castrated rats failed to produce an erection in response to apomorphine, an agent shown to produce erection in nearly all normal rats. Administration of exogenous testosterone propionate in dosages exceeding 60 micrograms./kg. produced a significant increase in erectile behavior. Yawning, an essentially parallel phenomenon to the stimulation of the erectile response, was also decreased following castration and responded similarly to increasing amounts of exogenous testosterone, demonstrating the influence of androgen functioning on the central nervous system. It was concluded that testosterone is a necessary prerequisite for the maintenance of a centrally induced erectile and yawning response. In an animal model of penile erection, testosterone increases the number of erections in a dose-dependent manner in castrated rats. The dependence of the erectile response on testosterone is, at least in part, centrally mediated.\n",
      "Using human college-age subjects, the present study tested the commonly cited but previously untested hypothesis that yawning is facilitated by higher than normal levels of CO2 or lower than normal levels of O2 in the blood by comparing the effect on yawning of breathing 100% O2 and gas mixtures with higher than normal levels of CO2 (3 or 5%) with compressed air, the control condition. If yawning is a response to heightened blood CO2, the CO2 mixtures should increase yawning rate and/or duration. If low blood O2 produced yawning, breathing 100% O2 should inhibit yawning. The CO2/O2 hypothesis was rejected because breathing neither pure O2 nor gases high in CO2 had a significant effect on yawning although both increased breathing rate. A second study found that exercise sufficient to double breathing rate had no effect on yawning. The two studies suggest that yawning does not serve a primary respiratory function and that yawning and breathing are triggered by different internal states and are controlled by separate mechanisms.\n",
      "This study examined the effects of 1,4-bis[3-(3,4,5-trimethoxy benzoyloxy)-propyl] perhydro-1,4-diazepine (dilazep; Comelian) on central dopaminergic, cholinergic, and purinergic neuronal systems in rats. Intraperitoneal injections of dilazep (1-5 mg/kg) produced yawning responses, the most effective dose being 2 mg/kg. Dilazep potentiated physostigmine-induced yawning but not pilocarpine- and bromocriptine-induced yawning. Dilazep-induced yawning was not affected by low doses of haloperidol or sulpiride, but was completely inhibited by atropine, a muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist. Dilazep-induced yawning, as well as physostigmine-induced yawning, were markedly inhibited by pretreatment with SK & F 38393, a dopamine D1 receptor agonist, and were potentiated by SCH23390, a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist that alone does not elicit yawning. Caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, inhibited dilazep- and physostigmine-induced yawning responses but N6-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA) and N6-(L-phenylisopropyl, adenosine (L-PIA), adenosine A1 receptor agonists, were inactive. These results suggest that because the effects of dilazep on central cholinergic neurons are similar to those of physostigmine dilazep may potentiate indirectly the action of endogenous acetylcholine. Cholinergic neurons activated by dilazep may be modulated by postsynaptic dopamine D1 receptor activity but may not be affected by dopamine D2 receptor activity. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of dilazep on cholinergic neuron may not be due to an inhibition of dopamine D1 receptors via purinergic (adenosine A1 receptor) stimulation by dilazep.\n",
      "The effect of electrolytic lesion of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) on yawning and penile erection induced by apomorphine, oxytocin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH1-24) was studied in male rats. In sham-operated rats, apomorphine (50 micrograms/kg s.c.), oxytocin (30 ng i.c.v.), and ACTH1-24 (10 micrograms i.c.v.) significantly increased the number of yawning and penile erection episodes. In PVN-lesioned rats, apomorphine- and oxytocin-, but not ACTH-induced responses were strongly reduced. These results confirm our previous observations showing that the PVN has a crucial role in the expression of yawning and penile erection induced by dopamino-mimetic drugs and oxytocin, and suggest that ACTH-derived peptides induce the above responses by a mechanism not involving PVN hypothalamic dopamine or oxytocin.\n",
      "A breathing technique, or effective breath method is important for both singers and speakers for effective vocalization, and also useful for helping people with a voice problem. Here a diaphragm support breath pattern was used in voice therapy for patients with vocal nodules, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, and incomplete glottal closure. Singing teachers use a technique, called the diaphragm breath support. This is called the yawning breath pattern (YBP) in our voice clinic and is used in teaching the patients with some kinds of voice disorder. In order to correct patients' breath pattern, an equipment system was designed to check their breath patterns conveniently in voice therapy practice. A respiratory kinematic sensor which connected to a TV monitor was attached to the patients' rib cage near the diaphragm, and by bio-feedback, patients could observe and adjust their breath pattern to the desired pattern during vocalization. In each of the 10 outpatient sessions, the patients performed for 20 to 30 min, and were instructed to practice at home for 3 or more times daily. The YBP method was applied to 91 patients, 17 males and 74 females, with ages ranging from 17 to 79 years. Of the 91 patients 41 had vocal nodules, 20 had recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and 30 had incomplete glottal closure associated with chronic laryngitis and sulcus vocalis. Most of the patients could master the YBP technique successfully. The higher the patients' ability to master the YBP was the better the results of both voice tests and subjective evaluation. The scientific background of the YBP method and its clinical effects in voice therapy was reviewed.\n",
      "Yawing was induced by microinjections of L-glutamate, cyanide and a nitric oxide-releasing compound (NOC12) into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. To evaluate physiological aspects of yawning, we monitored intercostal electromyogram (EMG) as an index of inspiratory activity, digastric EMG, blood pressure and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Microinjection of L-glutamate in the medial parvocellular subdivision (mp) elicited a stereotyped yawning response, i.e. an initial depressor response and an arousal shift in ECoG followed by a single large inspiration with mouth opening. The same sequential events were observed during spontaneous yawning, indicating that the mp is responsible for triggering yawning. Microinjection of cyanide into the mp caused the same yawning responses as the ones elicited by microinjection of L-glutamate, suggesting that the mp is sensitive to chemical hypoxia or ischemia within the PVN. Microinjection of NOC12 into the mp elicited a single large inspiration with a variable onset delay, suggesting that diffusible nitric oxide (NO) within the mp may act as a paracrine agent to cause a yawning response. We hypothesize that the mp of the PVN contains an oxygen sensor that causes a yawning response.\n",

      "Research has indicated that serotonin (5-HT) is involved in regulating male sexual behavior in rodent, as well as primate species. The present study was designed to further characterize 5-HT influences on male sexual behavior of rhesus monkeys. Experiment 1 examined the effects of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C/1D receptor stimulation on penile erections and yawning behavior. Administration of the 5-HT1C/1D receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP, 0.8 and 3.0 mg/kg), facilitated the occurrence of penile erection, and at doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg stimulated yawning. By contrast, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.01-0.2 mg/kg) did not significantly influence penile erections or yawning behavior. Experiment 2 evaluated the effects of m-CPP and 8-OH-DPAT on the behavior of male monkeys in the presence of a sexually receptive female monkey which the males could see, hear and smell, but not physically contact. Administration of m-CPP along with presentation of a receptive female stimulated penile erections to a greater extent than they were stimulated by either one of these manipulations alone. Administration of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) produced a decrease in the percent of monkeys exhibiting penile erections in the presence of the female. In this experiment, yawning was affected in opposite directions, with m-CPP stimulating and 8-OH-DPAT decreasing the frequency of yawning. Experiment 3 assessed the effects of m-CPP on male copulatory behavior of rhesus monkeys. Administration of m-CPP (0.8-3.0 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decline in the percent of males initiating copulation and achieving ejaculation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n"

      "1. The present study examined the effects of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist 4-amino-N-(2, 6 bis-methylamino-pyrimidin-4-yl)-benzene sulphonamide (Ro 04-6790) on locomotor activity and unconditioned behaviour in male Sprague Dawley rats (230-300 g). 2. In non-quantified behavioural observations, animals treated with Ro 04-6790 (3, 10 or 30 mg kg(-1), i.p) showed no overt behavioural signs except a dose-dependent reduction in locomotor activity and a behavioural syndrome of stretching, yawning and chewing. The latter behaviour was most pronounced between 30 and 90 min following the administration of Ro 04-6790. 3. Detailed analysis of the stretching and yawning behaviour showed that Ro 04-6790 (3, 10 or 30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) dose-dependently induced stretching. The number of stretches observed following treatment with either Ro 04-6790 (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) or Ro-04-6790 (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) was significantly greater than that observed in saline-treated rats. The yawning behaviour, however, was not dose-dependent nor was the number of yawns in any of the drug treated groups significantly greater than in those treated with saline. 4. Pretreatment (30 min) with the non-selective muscarinic antagonists scopolamine (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and atropine (0.3, 1 or 3 mg kg(-1), s.c.) but not methylatropine (1, 3 or 10 mg kg(-1), s.c) significantly inhibited stretching induced by Ro 04-6790 (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.). 5. The dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mg kg(-1), s.c.) given at the same time as Ro 04-6790 (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) had no effect on the stretching induced by the 5-HT6 antagonist. 6. These data suggest that systemic injection of the 5-HT6 antagonist, Ro 04-6790, produces a stretching behaviour that appears to be mediated by an increase in cholinergic neurotransmission in the CNS and which could be a useful functional correlate for 5-HT6 receptor blockade. There is no evidence for dopamine D2-like receptor involvement in this behaviour.\n",
      "Ontogenetic treatment of rats with the dopamine D(2)-like receptor agonist quinpirole produces a significant increase in dopamine D(2) receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the animal's lifetime, a phenomenon known as D(2) priming. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of priming of the D(2) receptor on the expression of three different members of the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) family: Rgs4, Rgs9 and Rgs17. Male offspring were ontogenetically treated with quinpirole or saline from postnatal days (P)1-21 and raised to adulthood. On approximately P65, animals were given an acute quinipirole injection (0.1 mg/kg) and the number of yawns was recorded for 1 h after the injection. Yawning has been shown to be a behavioural event mediated by the dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor. Animals ontogenetically treated with quinpirole demonstrated a significant 2.5-fold increase in yawning as compared to controls. Rgs transcripts were analysed through in situ hybridization several weeks later. Rats ontogenetically treated with quinpirole demonstrated a significant decrease in Rgs9 expression in the frontal cortex, but a more robust decrease in the striatum and nucleus accumbens as compared to controls. Regarding Rgs17, ontogenetic quinpirole produced a modest but significant increase in expression in the same brain areas. There were no significant differences in Rgs4 expression produced by drug treatment in any of the brain regions analysed. This study demonstrates that ontogenetic quinpirole treatment, which results in priming of the D(2) receptor, results in significant decreases in Rgs9, which has been shown to regulate G-protein coupling to D(2) receptors.\n",
      "The present study was undertaken to investigate whether beta-adrenoceptors are involved in regulation of yawning responses to oxytocin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in rats. Oxytocin administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at doses of 50 and 100 ng/rat elicited yawning. alpha-MSH (20 micrograms/rat, ICV) elicited not only yawning but also stretching and body shaking. RS-86 (2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8-diazaspiro-(4,5)-decan-1,3-dion hydrobromide), a putative muscarinic M1 receptor agonist, administered ICV at a lower dose of 100 micrograms/rat and subcutaneously (SC) at doses of 0.25-2.5 mg/kg also elicited yawning. The yawning responses produced by these agents were markedly increased by intraperitoneal (IP) pretreatment with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol (20 mg/kg), which per se did not elicit yawning. The yawning induced by oxytocin (50 ng/rat, ICV) plus pindolol, but not that by alpha-MSH (20 micrograms/rat, ICV) or RS-86 (0.5 mg/kg, SC) plus pindolol, was inhibited by [d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)2,Orn8]-vasotocin (100 ng/rat, ICV), an oxytocin receptor antagonist. The yawning induced by oxytocin, alpha-MSH, or RS-86 administered in combination with pindolol was inhibited by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a mucarinic receptor antagonist, without being affected by spiperone (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. The results suggest that the yawning produced by the neuropeptides oxytocin and alpha-MSH is modulated by beta-adrenoceptor activity in an inhibitory manner as that produced by muscarinic M1 receptor agonists, and that it involves cholinergic, but not dopaminergic, activation.\n",
      "This study was designed to investigate the central and peripheral activity profile of cholinesterase inhibitors in rats. Intravenous injection of cholinesterase inhibitors caused fasciculation, a fine involuntary muscular movement. This peripheral cholinergic sign was tightly correlated with in vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase activity by cholinesterase inhibitors, suggesting that fasciculation is a valid index of peripheral cholinergic activation. Yawning, used as a marker of central cholinergic activation, was also monitored. E2030 (3-(2-(1-(1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)-4-piperidyl)ethyl)-2H-3,4-dihydro-1,3-benzoxazin-2,4-dione hydrochloride) elicited yawning at more than 4 mg/kg, while fasciculation was significantly intensified only at a dose of 16 mg/kg. Donepezil and tacrine induced both yawning and fasciculation at doses greater than 4 mg/kg, whereas physostigmine induced both behaviors at a dose of 8 mg/kg and above. Finally, ipidacrine elicited yawning at a dose of 16 mg/kg and fasciculation at doses greater than 8 mg/kg. Thus, all putative centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitors elicited yawning. TAK-147 (3-[1-(phenylmethyl)-4-piperidinyl]-1-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepin-8-yl)-1-propanone fumarate) did not significantly elicit yawning at doses under 16 mg/kg, but elicited fasciculation at a dose of more than 4 mg/kg. Distigmine, a peripherally acting cholinesterase inhibitor, evoked fasciculations, but not yawning. When mild to moderate fasciculation was evoked, donepezil and E2030 elicited more than nine yawns over 30 min, while the other cholinesterase inhibitors elicited approximately five yawns at most during this period. These results indicated that E2030 and donepezil exhibited the most marked preferential central cholinergic activity, relative to peripheral activity, among cholinesterase inhibitors tested. Scopolamine, a centrally acting antimuscarinic drug, completely inhibited E2030-induced yawning, while peripherally acting methylscopolamine did not. Haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, partially blocked E2030-induced yawning, but did not block donepezil-induced yawning. These results suggest that central cholinergic and, in part, dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in E2030-induced yawning.\n",
      "This work compares the sensitivities of high-yawning (HY) and low-yawning (LY) sublines of Sprague-Dawley rats to dopaminergic and cholinergic yawning-inducing drugs. HY animals are significantly more sensitive to apomorphine and (-)3PPP than LY animals. Physostigmine is a less effective yawning-inducer in HY than in LY rats. With pilocarpine no differences were detected between both sublines in regard to its yawning-inducing activity. Since yawning behavior is subject to dopaminergic (inhibitory) and cholinergic (excitatory) influences, it is suggested that the genetic differences between these sublines affect the dopaminergic pathways that normally regulate yawning frequency.\n"

      "Mandibular functions such as speech, laughing, yawning, mastication, and taking a large bite may be impaired if temporomandibular disorders exist. The Mandibular Function Impairement Questionnaire is a validated instrument that scores perceived difficulty of representative mandibular functions in relation to jaw complaints. However, the reliability of the Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire has never been adequately tested. Generalizability and decision studies are currently proposed to assess the reliability of a measurement device. The smallest detectable difference is the smallest statistically significant amount of change to be detected with a measurement device. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of the Mandibular Function Impairement Questionnaire in terms of the smallest detectable difference. Twenty-five consecutive patients with painfully restricted temporomandibular joints completed the Mandibular Function Impairement Questionnaire on two separate measurement days, one week apart, using two consecutive sessions per day. Spearman's r was calculated for test-retest reliability. Variance components such as patients, measurement days, repetitions, and all their interactions were analyzed in the generalizability study. In the decision study, the smallest detectable difference was calculated for different days and repetitions. Spearman's r varied from 0.69 to 0.96. The between-patient variance and the error variance contributed 81% and 19% to total variance, respectively. The Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire is a reliable instrument for the assessment of mandibular function impairment. The minimal amount of change to be detected is 14 units on a scale of 0 to 68. Reliability in terms of the smallest detectable difference increases if the measurement is repeated twice on two separate days: The smallest detectable difference improves to 10 units.\n",
      "The effect of apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg s.c.) and oxytocin (30 ng i.c.v.) on penile erection and yawning was studied in intact and castrated male rats. In castrated rats both apomorphine and oxytocin responses were abolished. In these animals, testosterone (100 microgramS/kg s.c. once a day for 3 days), restored penile erection while estradiol benzoate (10 micrograms/kg s.c. once a day for 3 days) restored yawning induced by both compounds. 5-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or progesterone (each at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg s.c. once a day for 3 days) were ineffective. Given together, estradiol benzoate and DHT partially restored apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced yawning and penile erection, whereas estradiol benzoate and progesterone restored only yawning. Estradiol benzoate-induced recovery of yawning was prevented by the antiestrogen tamoxifen (1 mg/kg s.c. once a day for 3 days). In intact rats, progesterone increased and estradiol benzoate decreased apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced yawning without modifying penile erection, although oxytocin-induced yawning was prevented much less by estradiol benzoate than that induced by apomorphine. Testosterone or DHT were ineffective on both responses. Estradiol benzoate inhibition of apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced yawning was prevented by tamoxifen, which per se failed to modify apomorphine and oxytocin responses, as well as by testosterone or progesterone. The present results suggest that apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning are endocrine-dependent and differentially modulated by sexual steroids, suggesting that the mechanisms controlling the two behaviors are different even though they are often associated.\n",

      "A low dose of apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg s.c.), a mixed D1/D2 agonist that induces penile erection and yawning, increased the concentration of NO2-from 1.12 +/- 0.45 microM to 3.8 +/- 0.75 microM and NO3-from 5.53 +/- 0.82 to 11.25 +/- 2.30 microM in the dialysate collected from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of male rats by in vivo microdialysis. The NO2-concentration was also increased by LY 171555 (50 micrograms/kg s.c.), a D2 agonist that induces penile erection and yawning, but not by SKF 38393 (5 mg/kg s.c.), a D1 agonist with no effect on these responses. Conversely, apomorphine's effect on NO2-was prevented by haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a mixed D1/D2 antagonist and L-sulpiride (25 mg/kg i.p.), a D2 antagonist, but not by the D1 agonist SCH 23390 (50 micrograms/kg s.c.), although all three compounds prevented penile erection and yawning. The apomorphine effect on NO2-, penile erection and yawning was also prevented by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (200 micrograms i.c.v.). The nitric oxide scavenger haemoglobin (200 micrograms i.c.v.) also prevented the NO2-increase, but was ineffective against penile erection and yawning. In contrast, the oxytocin antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin (1 microgram i.c.v.) and the guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (300 micrograms i.c.v.) had no effect on the NO2-increase, but did prevent the behavioural responses. We infer from this that dopamine agonists induce penile erection and yawning by acting on D2 receptors that increase nitric oxide synthase activity in the cell bodies of paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas.\n",

      "Sudden darkness increases motor activity and decreases anxiety. In the present study, we focused on the role of dopaminergic mechanisms involved in the effects of sudden darkness. The influence of sudden darkness on the behavioral effects of low (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and high (0.25, 0.45 and 0.6 mg/kg) doses of apomorphine (APO) was tested. We assayed the effects of low APO doses on yawning-penile erection syndrome (YES; 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and on motor activity (0.05 mg/kg), and the effects of high APO doses on motor activity (0.25 mg/kg) and stereotyped behavior (0.45 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg). Spontaneous total and genital grooming of male and female rats were also recorded. Sudden darkness modified some spontaneous behaviors and also modulated several APO-induced behavioral effects. It increased spontaneous total grooming and genital grooming in male rats but had no effect on these parameters in female rats. These results show sexual dimorphism for total and genital grooming in both control and sudden darkness conditions. APO was able to induce YES in a dose-dependent manner. Sudden darkness decreased yawning elicited by both 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg of the drug. No other parameter of YES was modified. In the open-field test, sudden darkness increased total locomotion and rearing and decreased immobility duration. APO at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg had the opposite effect on these parameters under light conditions; none of them were modified by sudden darkness. Animals treated with APO at 0.25 mg/kg, a dose that augmented total locomotion and rearing and diminished immobility duration, were clearly divided into two groups according to their responses, i.e., hypo- and hyper-responsive rats. Sudden darkness improved total locomotion and rearing, reduced immobility duration and total grooming in the hyporesponsive group, and showed no effects on the hyper-responsive group. Sudden darkness caused no modifications of stereotyped behavior. These results may be due to a sudden darkness-induced physiological release of dopamine that diminishes pre-synaptic responses to APO and increases low-intensity post-synaptic responses such as motor activity without modifying high-intensity post-synaptic responses such as stereotyped behavior.\n",
      "1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP) (0.1-4 mg/kg s.c.) and N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (TFMPP) (0.5-4 mg/kg s.c.), 5-HT1C receptor agonists, but not 8-hydroxy-dipropylamino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg s.c.), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, induced penile erection and yawning with a U-inverted dose-response curve in male rats. The maximal effect was found with 0.5 mg/kg s.c. of m-CPP and with 1 mg/kg s.c. of TFMPP. The m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) and TFMPP (1 mg/kg s.c.) responses were prevented by mianserin (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) and by ritanserin (1 mg/kg s.c.) given 15 min before m-CPP and TFMPP. In contrast, m-CPP- or TFMPP-induced penile erection and yawning were not antagonized by haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) or by [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2,Orn8]vasotocin (5 micrograms i.c.v.). Apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection, but not yawning, was also antagonized by mianserin and less effectively by ritanserin. The results suggest that 5-HT1C receptor agonist-induced penile erection and yawning are not mediated by increased dopaminergic and/or oxytocinergic transmission, and raise the possibility that a neuronal dopamine-oxytocin-5-HT link is involved in the control of penile erection and not necessarily of yawning in male rats.\n"

      "The new compound (+) S-20499, an amino chromane derivative (8[-4[N-(5-methoxychromane-3yl)N-propyl]aminobutyl] azaspiro[4-5] décane-7,9 dione), is a high affinity full 5-HT1A agonist. We have investigated its effects on dopaminergic transmission. (+) S-20499 displayed a 10(-8) M affinity for D2 dopamine (DA) receptors, 100 fold lower than for 5-HT1A receptors. The hypothermic effect of the drug was reversed by haloperidol in mice, suggesting that it behaves as a direct dopamine agonist. However, increasing doses of (+) S-20499 induced neither yawning nor penile erections, which constitute characteristic responses of direct DA agonists administered at low doses. In addition, (+) S-20499 prevented the apomorphine (100 micrograms/kg SC) induced yawning and penile erections. This inhibition appears to result from the stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors since it is an effect shared by both buspirone (from 5 mg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT (from 0.10 mg/kg). In addition, when rats are treated with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist tertatolol (2-5 mg/kg; SC), increasing doses of (+) S-20499 elicit the expected yawns and penile erections. It is concluded that the 5-HT1A agonist property opposes to that of D2 dopamine receptor stimulation with regard to yawning and penile erections.\n",
      "Recent studies showed in vivo and in vitro that acutely introduced prolactin (PRL) excess was capable of diminishing penile erectile function independently of the LH-testosterone (T) dynamics. In the present investigation, we examined if such independent suppressive effects can be demonstrated in the pituitary-transplant rat model with chronically elevated serum PRL. We also compared the effects of pituitary transplantation and castration on the level of erectile activity. Rats were made hyperprolactinemic by homologous transplantation of three anterior pituitaries underneath the kidney capsules, with the eutopic pituitaries left in situ. Before and 3, 5, and 8 weeks after transplant or sham surgeries, 80 micrograms/kg s.c. injection of apomorphine was given as an inducer of erection. This was followed by 30-minute observation periods during which the numbers of erections and yawning were recorded. Similar experiments were also performed with castrated rats without transplanted pituitaries. In the transplanted rats plasma PRL was markedly elevated (51.4 +/- 3.7 ng/ml) and was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than the values in the sham group (6.0 +/- 2.7 ng/ml). In contrast, plasma T was not different (P > 0.05) between the two groups. The castrated rats showed very low plasma T (0.17 +/- 0.01 ng/ml, P < 0.05 compared to the sham group) and normal PRL (P > 0.05). The numbers of both erection and yawning were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) less in the transplant than in the sham group 8 weeks after surgeries. Castrated rats showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) only in the numbers of erection. These results indicated that the pituitary transplantation with chronic excess of PRL and castration with T deficiency caused roughly comparable degrees of suppression of penile erectile activity through mechanisms presumably independent from one another in the rat.\n",
      "Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE), also known as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), is a rare condition whose pathogenesis is unknown, though autoimmune-mediated mechanisms are thought to be involved. The prevalent neurological manifestations of this disorder are epileptic seizures and psychocognitive disorders associated with EEG alterations. High anti-thyroid antibody titers (particularly in cerebrospinal fluid) and the effectiveness of steroid therapy are usually considered to be crucial elements in the diagnostic process. We describe a 19-year-old female patient who had been referred to the psychiatric unit because of behavioral disorders characterized predominantly by delirium with sexual content. She developed recurrent focal seizures characterized by atypical ictal semiology (repetitive forceful yawning) and a rare EEG pattern (recurrent seizures arising from the left temporal region without evident \"encephalopathic\" activity). The presence of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in her cerebrospinal fluid and a good response to steroids confirmed the diagnosis of HE. The atypical presentation in the case we describe appears to widen the electroclinical spectrum of HE and highlights its importance for differential diagnosis purposes in the neuropsychiatric setting.\n",
      "The effect of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)(1-24) and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on grooming, stretching, yawning and penile erection was studied after injection into different brain areas. Both peptides induce the above responses when injected into the hypothalamic periventricular region of the third ventricle. This region includes the paraventricular nucleus, the dorsomedial nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus and the anterior hypothalamic area. The minimal effective dose of both peptides was 0.5 microg and the maximal effect was seen with 2 microg, the highest dose tested. Irrespective of the injection site, grooming started 5-7 min after injection of either peptide, while stretching, yawning and penile erection started only after 15-35 min and lasted for 90-120 min. In contrast both peptides were ineffective when injected into the preoptic area, the caudate nucleus or the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Grooming, stretching and yawning, but not penile erection, were prevented by cyclic[AcCys(11), D-Nal(14), Cys(18), AspNH(2)(22)]-beta-MSH (11-22) (HS014), a selective melanocortin 4 receptor antagonist, injected into the same periventricular area 10 min before of ACTH(1-24) or alpha-MSH. The results show that ACTH(1-24) and alpha-MSH act in the hypothalamic periventricular region to induce the above responses and that grooming, stretching and yawning, but not penile erection, are mediated by melanocortin 4 receptors.\n",

      "We examined the effects of light stimulation on cortical activation and yawning response in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. Cortical activation was assessed by means of an electrocorticogram (ECoG) and yawning response was evaluated by monitoring an intercostal electromyogram as an index of inspiratory activity and a digastric electromyogram as an indicator of mouth opening. Light stimulation elicited an arousal shift in the ECoG to faster rhythms. This arousal response was followed by a single large inspiration with mouth opening, i.e. a yawning response. Higher light intensity significantly reduced the onset latency of the arousal/yawning response. Pretreatment with pyrilamine, an H1-histamine receptor antagonist, injected into the lateral ventricle blocked both the cortical activation and the yawning response induced by light stimulation, suggesting a role of brain histaminergic neurotransmission in modulating the light-induced arousal/yawning responses.\n",

      "The aim of this study was the introduction of a specific class of signals, the so-called perfect sequences (PSEQ), in a novel approach for sonotubometry of the Eustachian tube (ET). Sonotubometry using PSEQ stimuli was performed on 20 healthy subjects in order to gauge its potential for clinical applications. In a series of 320 measurements ET opening was probed, which was induced by dry and water swallowing, Toynbee maneuver, and yawning. All sonotubograms were analyzed with respect to their shape, increase of sound intensity, and opening duration. In 298/320 measurements (>93%) the subjects reported subjective ET openings. The evaluation of the recorded sonotubograms showed good detection of ET opening for the inducing maneuvers of swallowing (dry and water swallowing) and the Toynbee maneuver, with 90, 86, and 80% valid sonotubograms, respectively. Yawning led to only 40% valid sonotubograms. In total, 237/320 (~74%) sonotubograms were classified as valid. The evaluation of the sound level increase during ET openings showed that it was significantly higher in measurements with dry and water swallowing, as well as Toynbee maneuvers (mean 17.1, 19.0 and 17.2 dB, respectively), than with yawning (mean 10.17 dB; P < 0.0001). Nasal decongestion was found to have little influence on the results (P > 0.05). Sonotubometry using PSEQ stimuli is a novel sonotubometry methodology that provides valuable information regarding the auditory tube patency. By further technical refinements of the method, a diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity could be developed.\n"

      "1. Yawning was induced by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of low doses of apomorphine to rats. This effect decreased with increasing doses of the drug. 2. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment of animals with sulpiride (D2-receptor blocker) reduced the frequency of the yawns induced by apomorphine, while SCH 23390 (D1-receptor blocker, s.c.) pretreatment increased the small number of yawns which was induced by higher doses of apomorphine. Administration of SCH 23390 alone to rats also produced a low degree of yawning. 3. Apomorphine-induced yawning was decreased in animals treated with SK&F 38393 (D1-agonist, i.p.), atropine (i.p.) or theophylline (i.p.). 4. Intraperitoneal injection of bromocriptine (D2-agonist) in rats also induced dose-dependent yawning. The effect was decreased in animals pretreated with sulpiride, while SCH 23390 pretreatment did not change bromocriptine-induced yawning significantly. Pretreatment of animals with SK&F 38393, atropine or theophylline reduced the number of yawns induced by bromocriptine. 5. Physostigmine (i.p.) but not neostigmine (i.p.) also induced yawning. The effect was antagonized by atropine or theophylline but not by sulpiride. Administration of SK&F 38393 decreased yawning induced by physostigmine. This inhibitory influence of SK&F 38393 was reduced by SCH 23390 in pretreated animals. Treatment of animals with SCH 23390 or bromocriptine increased the frequency of yawns induced by physostigmine. 6. It is concluded that D2-receptor activation elicits yawning through influence on cholinergic mechanisms, whereas D1-receptor stimulation decreases yawning behaviour by a negative influence on the cholinergic system.\n",
      "Purpose: To explore risk factors for the yawning response induced by the intravenous administration of thiopental during the induction of general anesthesia.\n",
      "Methods: We analyzed data from a cohort of 1322 patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia plus intravenous thiopental. The data collected were: (a) the patients' demographic findings (age, sex, height, weight, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and presence of cerebral lesion), and (b) anesthesia-related findings (the kind of preanesthetic medication, i.e., atropine, epidural lidocaine, priming dose of vecuronium, fentanyl, and the dose of intravenous thiopental). An association between an individual variable in the evaluation model and the likelihood of thiopental-induced yawning behavior was characterized by means of the odds ratio. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the independent contribution of each candidate variable, while controlling for all variables.\n",
      "Results: After the intravenous administration of thiopental, 461 patients exhibited a yawning response. The probability of this response was decreased by the prior use of intravenous fentanyl, by female sex, and by premedication with clonidine, but the probability was unaffected by premedication with hydroxyzine, by the prior use of atropine, or by the presence of hypertension or a cerebral lesion.\n",
      "Conclusion: Thiopental-induced yawning may be suppressed by female sex, prior use of intravenous fentanyl, and premedication with clonidine. These findings may allow insights into the physiologic and pharmacological aspects of yawning in humans, thereby leading to the development methods to prevent thiopental-induced yawning.\n",
      "Objective: Yawning is a frequent behavior with circadian effects. Sometimes, its frequency is very high and it is disturbing. However, there is no evidence-based treatment for yawning.\n",
      "Method: This is a case report of a man with severe yawning from about 2 years ago.\n",
      "Results: Yawning reduced after taking propranolol.\n",
      "Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that propranolol may decrease yawning through its thermoregulation effect. It is worthwhile conducting controlled clinical trials to study whether propranolol is an effective treatment for yawning.\n",

      "Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). It may manifest in the early stages of the disease and infrequently may even antedate the onset of motor symptoms. The cause of olfactory dysfunction in PD remains unknown. Pathological changes characteristic of PD (i.e., Lewy bodies) have been demonstrated in the olfactory bulb which contains a large population of dopaminergic neurons involved in olfactory information processing. Since dopaminergic drugs do not affect olfactory threshold in PD patients, it has been suggested that olfactory dysfunction in these patients is not dependent on dopamine deficiency. I present two fully medicated Parkinsonian patients with long standing history of olfactory dysfunction in whom recovery of smell occurred during therapeutic transcranial application of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla flux density. In both patients improvement of smell during administration of EMFs occurred in conjunction with recurrent episodes of yawning. The temporal association between recovery of smell and yawning behavior is remarkable since yawning is mediated by activation of a subpopulation of striatal and limbic postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors induced by increased synaptic dopamine release. A high density of dopamine D2 receptors is present in the olfactory bulb and tract. Degeneration of olfactory dopaminergic neurons may lead to upregulation (i.e., supersensitivity) of postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors. Presumably, small amounts of dopamine released into the synapses of the olfactory bulb during magnetic stimulation may cause activation of these supersensitive receptors resulting in enhanced sense of smell. Interestingly, in both patients enhancement of smell perception occurred only during administration of EMFs of 7 Hz frequency implying that the release of dopamine and activation of dopamine D2 receptors in the olfactory bulb was partly frequency dependent. In fact, weak magnetic fields have been found to cause interaction with biological systems only within narrow frequency ranges (i.e., frequency windows) and the existence of such frequency ranges has been explained on the basis of the cyclotron resonance model.\n",

      "Yawning is considered a brainstem regulated behavior which is associated with changes in arousal and activity levels. Yawning and stretching are dopamine (DA) mediated behaviors and pharmacological studies indicate that these behaviors are associated with increased DA release coupled with stimulation of postsynaptic DA-D2 receptors. Despite their relation to the dopaminergic system, yawning and stretching are poorly documented in untreated or treated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A 49 year old fully medicated female patient with juvenile onset PD is presented in whom recurrent episodes of yawning and stretching developed during transcranial administration of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EM Fs) of picotesla flux density. These episodes have not been observed previously in this or other patients during treatment with levodopa or DA receptor agonists or in unmedicated PD patients during treatment with AC pulsed EMFs. It is suggested that yawning and stretching behavior resulted in this patient from a synergistic interaction between EMFs and DA derived from levodopa supplementation with EMFs possibly facilitating the release of DA and simultaneously activating postsynaptic DA-D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. In addition, it is postulated that the release of ACTH/MSH peptides from peptidergic neurons in the brain upon stimulation of the DA-D2 receptors reinforced the yawning and stretching behavior.\n",

      "5-HT2 receptors regulate sleep including yawning behavior. Ritanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, increases the duration of slow wave in rats and humans. This effect is more pronounced during the light period when melatonin plasma levels are low; melatonin inhibits the sleep effects of ritanserin. These findings indicate that melatonin co-determines the effects of ritanserin on sleep. In a cohort of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, induces recurrent yawning particularly when administered in daytime. The frequency of yawning induced by the drug was modified by AC pulsed picotesla flux electromagnetic fields (EMFs) which affect melatonin secretion. Two MS patients are presented in whom the frequency of ketanserin-induced yawning was altered in opposite directions by these EMFs. The first patient, a 50 year old woman with a remitting-relapsing course, developed recurrent yawning and sleepiness after administration of ketanserin (10 mg, PO). Yawning was decreased dramatically during application of EMFs but was unaffected by a placebo EMFs treatment. The second patient, a 35 year old man with a chronic progressive course, manifested a single and brief yawn after administration of an equal dose of ketanserin. Yawning was increased dramatically during application of EMFs while remaining unchanged during a placebo EMFs treatment. These observations demonstrate a bidirectional effect of picotesla flux EMFs on ketanserin-induced yawning which may be related to differences in daytime melatonin plasma levels among MS patients. If validated by estimations of melatonin plasma levels in a larger cohort of patients the information derived from the effects of picotesla EMFs on ketanserin-induced yawning could be used to: (a) assess pineal melatonin functions in patients with MS; (b) indicate differences in pineal functions between male and female MS patients; and (c) indicate a relationship between plasma melatonin levels and the fatigue of MS.\n"

      "In the adult rhesus monkey, yawning is an androgen-dependent sexually dimorphic behavior with males yawning more frequently than do females reflecting sex differences in circulating androgens. Studies in a variety of species indicate that yawning is mediated by various neurochemicals including dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin. In rhesus monkeys, exogenous androgen reliably induces yawning in females to male-like levels. This study investigated whether flutamide, a nonsteroidal anti-androgen, reverses yawning induced by exogenous androgen administration in adult female rhesus monkeys. Six adult female rhesus monkeys were given chronic DHT alone and in combination with daily injections of flutamide and observed for yawning behavior. Treatment with DHT alone significantly increased yawning from 0.3 yawns per 30 min at the pretreatment baseline to 4.7 yawns per 30 min. Concurrent administration of flutamide significantly reduced the rate of yawning to 1.9 yawns per 30 min. These data indicate that flutamide is an effective tool for blocking the central effects of androgens in rhesus monkey females and that androgens regulate yawning similarly in both males and females.\n",
      "A variety of associated movements have been described in patients with pyramidal tract lesions. We report three patients in whom involuntary stretching of an otherwise plegic arm could be observed during yawning. These patients had radiologically verified lesions at different levels of the pyramidal tract. As yawning and stretching are an automatic behavioural pattern in animals, it is likely that stretches during yawning in man are also an automatic motor pattern, usually inhibited in the presence of an intact corticospinal tract. The physiological function of yawning is unclear at present. Yawning might be the somatomotor manifestation of a particular emotional state characterized by boredom and fatigue. Our observation that movements of an otherwise plegic arm occur in patients with pyramidal tract lesions supports therefore the concept of an emotional motor system which has an independent input to motoneurones in the brain stem and the spinal cord.\n",
      "By inbreeding we have obtained two sublines of Sprague-Dawley rats which differ significantly in spontaneous mean yawning frequency (MYF). In generation F21 of the high-yawning (HY) subline MYF was 21.5 yawns/h (y/h) in males and 1.95 y/h in females, at the age of 2 months. In the low-yawning (LY) subline, in generation F16 the MYF was 0.9 y/h in males and only 0.5 y/h in females. During the first 15 days there are no differences in yawning frequency between HY and LY rats. Thereafter yawning increases with age, more steeply in the HY subline. The results of reciprocal crosses between both sublines indicate that the LY character is partially dominant over the HY one.\n",
      "Eating high fat food can alter sensitivity to drugs acting on dopamine systems; this study examined whether eating high fat food alters sensitivity to a drug acting on serotonin (5-HT) systems. Sensitivity to (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; 5-HT1A receptor agonist)-induced lower lip retraction was examined in separate groups (n=8-9) of rats with free access to standard (5.7% fat) or high fat (34.3% fat) chow; sensitivity to quinpirole (dopamine D3/D2 receptor agonist)-induced yawning was also examined. Rats eating high fat chow gained more body weight than rats eating standard chow and, after 6 weeks of eating high fat chow, they were more sensitive to 8-OH-DPAT (0.01-0.1 mg/kg)-induced lower lip retraction and quinpirole (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg)-induced yawning. These changes were not reversed when rats that previously ate high fat chow were switched to eating standard chow and sensitivity to 8-OH-DPAT and quinpirole increased when rats that previously ate standard chow ate high fat chow. These data extend previous results showing changes in sensitivity to drugs acting on dopamine systems in animals eating high fat chow to a drug acting at 5-HT1A receptors and they provide support for the notion that eating certain foods impacts sensitivity to drugs acting on monoamine systems.\n",
      "We have reported that an arousal response accompanied by yawning behavior can be evoked by electrical and chemical stimulation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in rats, although the mechanism responsible for the arousal response accompanied by yawning evoked by PVN stimulation is still unknown. In the present study, we examined the involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the arousal response during yawning induced by electrical stimulation of the PVN in anesthetized, spontaneous breathing rats using intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of alpha-helical CRF, a CRF antagonist (4.2 microg, lateral ventricle). The electrocorticogram (ECoG) was recorded to evaluate arousal responses during yawning. Fast Fourier transform was used to obtain the power spectrum in delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-20 Hz) bands. We also recorded the intercostal electromyogram as an index of inspiratory activity and blood pressure (BP) as an index of autonomic function to evaluate yawning response. PVN stimulation induced significant increases in relative powers of theta, alpha, and beta bands, but not delta band, concurrent with yawning events regardless of icv injection, though the relative powers after icv injection of alpha-helical CRF were significantly lower than those after saline injection. These findings suggest that CRF neurons in the PVN are primarily responsible for the arousal response accompanied by yawning behavior.\n",

      "The effect of systemic administration of the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxyamide) on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine was investigated in rats. SR 141716A (2 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 40 min before apomorphine (40 and 80 microg/kg, s.c.) increased the number of penile erection and yawning responses. The administration of cannabinoid agonist Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before apomorphine (40 and 80 microg/kg, s.c.) did not affect penile erection, however it decreased yawning. The present results provide additional evidence that cannabinoid agonists interfere with dopaminergic systems and that SR 141716A together with a dopaminergic agonist could be useful to potentiate dopaminergic activity.\n",
      "It is known that dopamine (DA) receptors can be sensitized by repeated treatments with quinpirole during postnatal development. This study was undertaken to determine whether low-dose quinpirole treatments might sensitize receptors to quinpirole-induced yawning behavior. Rats were treated with quinpirole HCl (50 micrograms/kg per day) or saline at four different periods of ontogeny: a) the 10th day of gestation to day of birth; b) 1st-11th days after birth; c) 12th-22nd days from birth; or d) 23rd-33rd days from birth. The numbers of yawns occurring in 1 h after a challenge dose of quinpirole HCl (50 micrograms/kg, IP) was determined at 6 weeks. Rats exposed prenatally to quinpirole demonstrated increased numbers of yawns following the third dose of quinpirole (2-day interval between doses). In rats exposed postnatally to quinpirole, there was a 70-300% increase in the yawning response, with the greatest response occurring in the group treated with quinpirole from birth to 11 days from birth. The findings demonstrate that quinpirole receptors are sensitized by a low dose of quinpirole, 60-fold lower than previously shown. It is suggested that sensitized receptors are of the DA D3 subclass.\n",
      "In rats, a syndrome of yawning and penile erection results from the administration of low doses of apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist shown to stimulate dopamine autoreceptors. Ethanol has been shown to influence dopamine metabolism. Low doses of ethyl alcohol (0.25 mg./kg.) failed significantly to alter apomorphine-induced yawning or penile erection, while 0.5 mg./kg. decreased erectile behavior but did not significantly alter the number of yawns. A reduction in both yawning and penile erection in response to apomorphine challenge was seen after the acute intraperitoneal injection of relatively high doses (1.0-3.0 mg./kg.) of ethanol. Two possible mechanisms of action may explain these phenomena. Alcohol may interfere with dopaminergic receptor mechanisms, or conversely, alcohol, through its actions on central dopamine metabolism may alter a second neurotransmitter/neuropeptide more directly responsible for the production of apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erection, possibly oxytocin.\n"

      "Background: Tear ascorbate is important for corneal health. A rapid and simple method for measurement of ascorbate in tears is needed, and adequate knowledge of physiological variation of tear ascorbate is important to facilitate comparative studies of the effect of, for example, contact lens wear and environmental conditions and stresses. However, there are currently no data on physiological variation of tear ascorbate. This study validated a simple and speedy method for tear ascorbate and investigated between-eye and between-day variation in tear ascorbate in healthy young adults.\n",
      "Methods: Yawn-induced reflex tears were collected from 32 healthy Hong Kong Chinese subjects and measured by both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and by an enzyme-linked colorimetric method known as FRASC (total ferric reducing (antioxidant) activity and ascorbate concentration measurement). For between-eye variation, yawn reflex tears were collected from each eye of the same 32 healthy subjects, and ascorbate was measured using HPLC; in a separate experiment for between-day variation, tears were collected on two separate days from 14 subjects, and ascorbate was measured by FRASC.\n",
      "Results: Both HPLC and FRASC showed high precision, and results obtained using FRASC were not statistically different from those using HPLC; mean +/- SD were, respectively, 18.5 +/- 4.4 microM and 18.5 +/- 4.8 microM for HPLC and FRASC methods (p = 0.943). No significant between-eye difference in tear ascorbate was found (p = 0.386), and no significant between-day variation was found overall: mean +/- SD ascorbate was 20.0 +/- 6.2 microM on day 1 and 19.3 +/- 6.8 microM on day 2 (p = 0.772). However, between-day variation was large in seven of 14 subjects.\n",
      "Conclusion: FRASC is an acceptable alternative to HPLC for measurement of tear ascorbate. Tears for ascorbate investigation can be collected from either eye or, if necessary, from both eyes and pooled. However, tear ascorbate may vary widely from day to day in the same individual. The reasons for this variation require further study but may relate to differences in ascorbate supply or demand within the precorneal tear layer.\n",

      "By testing the effects of antecedent copulation on subsequent apomorphine-induced penile erection we sought to test an implicit assumption in the research on drug-induced \"spontaneous\" erection--namely, that this research provides information relevant to the regulation of erection in copula. In experiment 1, male rats were observed after being injected SC with 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 micrograms/kg apomorphine (APO); 60 micrograms/kg yielded the maximum probability of erection and yawning. In experiment 2, males were injected with 60 micrograms/kg APO after no exposure to females, after three intromissions, or after copulation to sexual satiety. There was no significant effect of three intromissions, but sexually sated males displayed no erections, the first evidence that copulation affects drug-induced erections. In experiment 3, males had one ejaculation, three intromissions, or no exposure to females immediately before injection with APO (60 micrograms/kg, SC) or ascorbic acid vehicle. APO induced both erection and yawning, but neither behavior was reliably affected by copulation in APO-treated males. Among vehicle-treated males, those having three intromissions or one ejaculation before the test had shorter erection latencies and more erections than males not exposed to females. Thus, a relatively small amount of copulation resulted in a level of erectile response similar to that of APO-treated males. Optimal doses of APO may be no more effective in promoting erection in male rats than are the natural neurochemical sequelae to copulation.\n",
      "1. The erectile response to the short-acting dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, apomorphine (Apo) HCl (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mg sc), and placebo was evaluated in 28 impotent patients and penile circumference monitored using a mercury strain gauge and strip chart recording. 2. A full erection (increment in penile circumference greater than 2 cm and lasting at least one minute) occurred in 17 patients with Apo; no erection developed after placebo. An erection occurred in 6/8 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, 2/6 patients with diabetes mellitus and in both patients on lithium. 3. Nine patients who responded to Apo were treated in an open trial with bromocriptine; 6 reported improvement in potency. 4. Impairment in DA function may play a role in idiopathic impotence and in impotence associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus. 5. An erectile response to Apo may predict therapeutic response to bromocriptine or other long acting dopaminergic agents. 6. Lithium, which inhibits DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase, does not prevent Apo-induced erections. This provides further support indicating that Apo induces erections by an effect on D2 receptors. 7. The yawning response to placebo and four doses of Apo HC1 (3.5, 5.0, 7.0, and 10.5 ug/kg sc) was evaluated in five normal men using a polygraphic technique. The yawning response was also assessed in normal young (less than 30 yrs; N = 16) and elderly (greater than 60 yrs; N = 12) volunteers. 8. Under experimental conditions of study, placebo induced spontaneous yawning. This was antagonized by 3.5 and 5.0 ug/kg Apo HC1 but increased by 7.0 ug/kg Apo HC1. These observations are compatible with the view that Apo HC1 in doses of 3.5-5.0 ug/kg stimulates presynaptic DA receptors whereas 7.0 ug/kg stimulates postsynaptic DA receptors. 9. Spontaneous and Apo-induced yawning were significantly decreased in the elderly which suggests that D2 receptor function declines with normal aging.\n",

      "The effect of the central administration of nitroglycerin, a potent organic nitrate vasodilator, on penile erection and yawning was studied in male rats. When given intracerebroventricularly (ICV), nitroglycerin (33-99 micrograms) induced the above responses dose-dependently. The minimal effective dose was 33 micrograms, which was active in 60% of the rats. Nitroglycerin (1.65-6.6 micrograms) induced penile erection and yawning also when injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Nitroglycerin responses were prevented by methylene blue (200-400 micrograms ICV), by d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2-Orn8-vasotocin (0.5-1 micrograms ICV) but not hemoglobin (100-200 micrograms ICV). In contrast methylene blue (10-20 micrograms), d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2-Orn8-vasotocin (0.05-0.1 microgram) and hemoglobin (10-20 micrograms) were ineffective when injected in the paraventricular nucleus. Systemic haloperidol (0.5-1 mg/kg IP) was also ineffective. The results suggest that nitroglycerin induces penile erection and yawning by activating brain oxytocinergic transmission through the formation of nitric oxide in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n",
      "Nitric oxide (NO) in brain has been implicated in neuronal regulatory processes and in neuropathologies. Previously we showed that NO modified quinpirole-induced yawning, a behavioral measure of dopamine (DA) D3 receptor activation in rats. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of nitro-L-arginine methyl ester HCl (NAME) and L-arginine HCl on reactivity of rats to the DA D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 and DA D1 antagonist SCH 23390 in intact and neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats (134 micrograms of base ICV at 3rd day after birth). L-arginine HCl (300 mg/kg i.p.) increased the oral activity response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, like SKF 38393, and induced catalepsy in intact control rats, like SCH 23390. In contrast, NAME had no effect on oral activity or catalepsy, but fully attenuated SKF 38393-induced oral activity. These findings indicate that L-arginine HCl has no apparent effect at the DA D1 receptor, but that NAME is effective in attenuating a DA D1 agonist-induced effect. Consequently NO may be an intracellular second messenger for supersensitized receptors associated with DA D1 agonist-induced oral activity.\n",
      "The effect of omega-conotoxin GVIA, a potent and selective inhibitor of N-type calcium channels and of the organic calcium channel inhibitors nimodipine, verapamil and flunarizine, on stretching, yawning and penile erection induced by ACTH 1-24 was studied in male rats. omega-Conotoxin (1-10 ng ICV 15 min before ACTH, 10 micrograms ICV), but not carboxymethylated omega-conotoxin, induced a dose-dependent prevention of all ACTH effects. In contrast, organic calcium channel inhibitors (20 mg/kg IP 30-60 min before ACTH) failed to modify ACTH-induced stretching and yawning but induced a 25% decrease in the number of penile erection episodes induced by the peptide, and prevented, like ICV omega-conotoxin, oxytocin- and apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erection. When injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, omega-conotoxin prevented the above behavioral responses induced by apomorphine and oxytocin but not by ACTH 1-24. The present results suggest that ACTH induces stretching, yawning and penile erection by mobilizing calcium through central omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium channels in brain sites different from those sensitive to oxytocin and apomorphine.\n"

      "Twenty-one children aged 5-6 years (mean age: 71.2 months; S.D. = 2.7) were videotaped in 4 different kindergartens throughout the school day for a period of one week. Eighteen of these children were then followed up after the summer holidays and videotaped for one week while attending the first year of primary school. The behaviors measured for each child were yawning and general motor activity. It was found that: (1) The frequency of yawning appears to be 5 times higher in the first year of primary school than in the last year of kindergarten; (2) Throughout the school-day the percentage of yawning children is higher in the first year of primary school, with the exception of the 1400-1430 period; (3) In the first year of primary school, the percentage of yawning children and the frequency of yawning peak between 900 and 930 and 1430 and 1500; (4) In this school institution the percentage of children who get up from their chair and spontaneously move above increases from the beginning to the end of each school-day. Three cardio-vascular variables were investigated in 17 children of the sample population: heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We found that: (1) The lowest values for heart rate in the first year of primary school are in agreement with the classical data of child development, as the children are 5-6 months older than in the last year of kindergarten. However, this is not the case at 1400 when the heart rate peaks at a higher level in the first year of primary school; (2) If the evolution in time of the blood pressure agrees in both institutions with the classical data of human chronobiology, i.e. the maximum values at 1400, the differences in mean level at all times during the school day between both institutions do not agree with what is commonly accepted, i.e. an increase in blood pressure with age; (3) The amplitude of the variations of the heart rate and blood pressure from one 30-min period to another throughout the school day is significantly higher in primary school. The comparison of the data obtained in both school institutions suggests that the observed differences are related to sharp modifications in school rhythms and constraints when the children go from the last year of kindergarten to the first year of primary school.\n",
      "Temporal lobe epilepsy is a partial epileptic disorder in which mesial structures are responsible for the principal ictal symptoms. Its characteristic feature is the recurrence of simple and complex partial seizures, associated with postictal confusion and amnesia of the event. The facilitating effect of NREM sleep on the propagation of the seizure, as well as the sleep abnormalities provoked by epilepsy were evident in our two patients. Yawning is a physiological reflex induced by arousal and drowsiness and may appear in different neurological conditions. Its relation with epilepsy of limbic origin has been rarely reported. We describe in a 95 year old male patient, the occurrence of yawning followed by complex partial seizure during a state of drowsiness. His EEG showed independent bilateral interictal foci of temporal sharp waves and after being medicated with carbamazepine 400 mg/day, the episode did not recur. Another patient, a 17 year old female, displayed complex partial seizures and secondarily generalized seizures with yawning during the posictal period, after naps. The EEG was normal and her polysomnography showed bilateral synchronous temporal spikes and slow waves with secondarily generalization during stage 2 of NREM sleep that produce paroxysmal microarousals and increased stages 1 and 2 of NREM sleep and REM sleep diminished. After being medicated with divalproex sodium 750 mg/day, she suffered no further seizures. Temporal lobe epilepsy, sleep-wake cycles and yawning seem not only to share the same anatomic structures but also the same neurochemical mechanisms. The fact that endogenous opiods are considered as part of a protective system that stop and prevent seizures may allow us to postulate that yawning would be the expression of the endogenous opiods induced mechanisms that stop and prevent the recurrence of the temporal lobe epilepsy. Another hypothesis may be that this is only a particular form of temporal lobe epilepsy.\n",
      "In a first series of experiments, different selective dopamine D2 receptor agonists (B-HT 920, B-HT 958, SND 919, CQ 32-084, CQP 201-403, and lisuride) and the D1/D2 agonist apomorphine were IP injected into adult male rats. At low doses, they elicited repeated episodes of penile erection and stretching-yawning: at all doses tested, B-HT 920, B-HT 958, and CQ 32-084 also induced hypomotility, a sign that, in the case of high doses of SND 919, CQP 201-403, lisuride, and apomorphine, was replaced by stereotyped behaviour. In a second series of experiments, the same D2 agonists and the mixed D1/D2 agonist apomorphine were IP injected at the same doses into chicks. The following behavioural signs were observed: hypomotility, sleep-like state, and stereotyped pecking. The results show that: 1. there are similarities between the behavioural effects induced by the DA agonists in rats and chicks; and 2. in both species some behavioural signs elicited by the DA ergic compounds are useful pointers to their specific neurochemical activity.\n",
      "Four-day-old (P4) and 21-22-day-old (P21-22) rat pups received an intracisternal injection of either ACTH1-16NH2 or saline followed by a subcutaneous (SC) injection of saline, the serotonergic (5HT)1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT or ipsapirone, the 5HT1B agonist TFMPP or the 5HT2 agonist DOI. The ontogeny of ACTH-induced behaviors including grooming, yawn and stretch as well as various serotonin-related behaviors were recorded via time-sampling at 20 s intervals for a test duration of 50 min. ACTH induced slight but significant increases in grooming at P4, along with a significant increase in yawning. At this age the 5HT1B agonist TFMPP induced substantial increases in grooming, with no effect of the other agonists on this behavior. All of the serotonergic agonists, however, decreased ACTH-induced yawning at P4. At P21-22 ACTH induced more robust grooming than that observed at P4, although different in nature from adult-typical ACTH-induced grooming. This ACTH-induced grooming at P21-22 was attenuated by all of the serotonergic agonists. ACTH-induced yawning at P21-22 was not affected by the serotonergic agonists while ACTH-induced stretching was increased by the 5HT1B agonist TFMPP at this age. These data provide additional evidence of differential mediation of various ACTH-induced behaviors, and support other reports of ontogenetic alterations in the response to serotonergic manipulations during the neonatal to weanling age period.\n",
      "A behavioral study was performed in an attempt to understand the neuronal mechanisms involved in yawning behavior in rats. Subcutaneous injections of low doses of apomorphine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) or piribedil (0.2-1.0 mg/kg), which preferentially activate presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors at those doses, evoked yawning. Marked yawning responses were also elicited by both 3-PPP (5-20 mg/kg, SC) and TL-99 (1-2 mg/kg, SC). SK & F 38393, a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist, at doses ranging from 0.1 to 8.0 mg/kg (SC) induced neither yawning nor stereotypy. However, bromocriptine (0.5-32.0 mg/kg, SC), a dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, induced yawning for which the dose-response curves showed a bell-shaped form. After a higher dose of 32 mg/kg (SC) bromocriptine, some rats occasionally showed sniffing and sawdust chewing. Yawning responses induced by systemic injection of apomorphine, piribedil, 3-PPP or bromocriptine were wholly suppressed after treatment with sulpiride (10 mg/kg SC), a dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist. Bilateral injections of apomorphine (20 micrograms/side X 2), piribedil (100 micrograms/side X 2) or 3-PPP (50, 100 micrograms/side X 2) into the striatum or septum also elicited marked yawning. The results indicate that low doses of apomorphine, piribedil, 3-PPP, TL-99 or bromocriptine elicit yawning by stimulating dopamine D-2 receptors and striatal and septal dopaminergic systems may be related to the occurrence of yawning behavior.\n"

      "This experimental study was conducted in the inpatient detoxification addictive behavior unit of the Sant Pau Hospital in Barcelona and included 22 healthy subjects (HS) and 42 intravenous heroin-dependent subjects (HDS). Apomorphine-induced yawning rates were investigated in three different groups; heroin-dependent patients stabilized on d-propoxiphene, heroin-dependent patients recently withdrawn from d-propoxiphene and normal controls. Yawning responses were recorded continuously by independent observers for periods of 45 minutes following administration of low doses of subcutaneous apomorphine and NaCl. The lowest subcutaneous apomorphine dose able to induce a significantly higher number of yawning responses in HS was 0.005 mg/kg. The yawning responses induced by this dose in HDS were also significantly higher than those induced by placebo. When comparing the number of yawning responses between the study groups, differences were observed only between HDS and HS and no effect of gender was obtained. The apomorphine test may be useful in assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption and could be a stable and reliable biological marker of heroin-dependence disorders.\n",
      "Paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) induces changes in behaviors induced by dopaminergic and cholinergic agonists, including increased aggressive behavior and stereotypy, decreased number of yawns, and shedding of bloody tears in male rats. In female rats, however, very little is known about the relationship between PSD and the effect of these drugs. The present study sought to examine this issue. As in males, PSD in females resulted in increased apomorphine-induced stereotypy, decreased pilocarpine-induced chromodacryorrhea, and hyperthermia. Unlike males, however, no apomorphine-induced aggressiveness or apomorphine- and pilocarpine-induced yawning were observed in PSD females. These findings suggest that female sexual hormones may affect the expression of some behaviors and not the neurotransmission as a whole, because drug-induced behaviors in PSD females were partly similar to those observed in PSD males.\n",
      "Yawning behavior was used to evaluate the sensitivity of presynaptic dopamine receptors and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors of normal and REM sleep-deprived (REMSD) rats. The results show a lowering of the dose-response curve obtained with apomorphine and pilocarpine, as well as a shift to the right in the curve obtained with physostigmine. These results suggest that REMSD induces subsensitization of presynaptic dopamine receptors and/or postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors with different characteristics related to the mechanism of action of the cholinomimetic agent employed.\n",
      "The effects of ketamine on some experimental models for detecting dopaminergic activity were studied in rats. Small doses of ketamine (0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg, ip) induced yawning behavior while higher doses (15 and 30 mg/kg, ip) inhibited both apomorphine- and amphetamine-induced stereotyped behaviors. Ketamine (up to 60 mg/kg, ip) per se failed to elicit typical stereotype or catalepsy similar to that induced by dopamine agonists or antagonists, respectively. Ketamine may have acted as an agonist on dopaminergic autoreceptors. These results do not support the view that the behavioral effects of ketamine are mediated by purely dopaminergic mechanisms.\n",
      "The effects of microinjection of histamine into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus on yawning responses were investigated in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. Yawning responses were evaluated by monitoring the intercostal electromyogram (EMG) as an index of inspiratory activity and digastric EMG as an indicator of mouth opening. We also recorded the electrocorticogram (ECoG) to determine the arousal response during yawning. Autonomic function was evaluated by measuring blood pressure and heart rate. Microinjection of histamine into the medial parvocellular subdivision (mp) of the PVN elicited a yawning response, i.e. a single large inspiration with mouth opening, and an arousal shift in ECoG to lower voltage and faster rhythms. Microinjection of HTMT dimaleate, an H1 receptor agonist, into the PVN also caused the yawning/arousal response. Pretreatment with pyrilamine, an H1 receptor antagonist, inhibited the histamine induced yawning behavior. These data demonstrate that a histamine receptive site for triggering yawning/arousal responses exists in the PVN, and suggest that these responses are mediated by activation of H1 receptor within the PVN.\n",
      "As well as being present in all mammals, yawning occurs, at least in its mandibular component, in all vertebrates. The existence of pathological and pharmacologically induced yawning justifies study of this everyday ENT reflex. Its mechanism remains uncertain. The most likely hypothesis would seem to be stimulation of the reticular system of the brain-stem by signals originating in masseteric neuromuscular spindles sensitive to stretching. Serotoninergic inhibition from the dorsal raphe, a fall in hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibitory tone, followed by ocytocinergic hippocampal activation and then more diffuse cholinergic activation of cranial nerve motor nuclei seems likely. Various hormonal or socio-environmental influences can modify the activity of these different systems. The physiological consequences and the communicative value of yawning become more diversified with the phylogenetic evolution of the subject. Yawning appears to correspond to an alertness reflex which has acquired a paralinguistic value with evolution and may have a role in protection or social cohesion.\n",
      "The effect of chronic administration of trifluoperazine on the perioral movement profile of Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats was examined. Perioral movements were characterised by visual observations, coupled with electromyographic recording from the masseter muscle. In drug-naive animals from both strains the spectrum of perioral behaviours was essentially identical, primarily consisting of purposeless chewing, accompanied by occasional bursts of facial tremor and teeth chattering, with occasional yawning. Each burst of facial tremor was accompanied by a transient increase in the rate of purposeless chewing. Wistar rats exhibited a higher level of spontaneous purposeless chewing compared to Sprague-Dawley rats. In both strains, chronic administration of trifluoperazine (5 mg/kg per day, PO) for 5 months induced an increase in perioral behaviour, which primarily consisted of enhanced purposeless chewing. In Wistar rats the drug-induced increase in purposeless chewing was accompanied by an increase in the incidence of yawning, with no change in the incidence of either facial tremor or teeth chattering. In contrast, Sprague-Dawley rats displayed a drug-induced increase in purposeless chewing, accompanied by an increase in the incidence of facial tremor and teeth chattering, but not yawning. In Wistar rats withdrawal of trifluoperazine diminished but did not reverse the drug-induced increase in purposeless chewing. Drug withdrawal also precipitated a transient increase in the incidence of facial tremor and teeth chattering, but had no effect on yawning. In Wistar rats, the level of purposeless chewing and the incidence of yawning remained elevated above control levels for at least 13 weeks after drug withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "In many animal species, the ICV injection of ACTH and of several shorter sequences of the ACTH molecule (melanocortin peptides) induces a peculiar behavioral syndrome mainly characterized by excessive grooming and by repeated acts of stretching and yawning. In adult males, spontaneous penile erections with ejaculation are also induced. We have studied the effect of NO synthase inhibition on this behavioral syndrome. The IP injection of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (NAME) significantly prevented--at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg--all the behavioral symptoms induced by the ICV administration of ACTH(1-24) (4 micrograms/rat). On the other hand, the ICV injection of NAME (up to 300 micrograms/rat) had no influence on the ACTH-induced excessive grooming and stretching, while significantly inhibited the display of yawnings and penile erections. These data indicate that brain NO synthase is involved in the mechanism of ACTH-induced yawning and penile erections, whereas peripheral NO synthase is involved in the induction of stretching and grooming.\n"

      "The ability of bromocriptine (BRC), a selective dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, to induce yawning responses was studied in rats pretreated with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). BRC (1 20 mg/kg IP) evoked yawning responses, which were pronounced at 2.5 mg/kg and characterized by the head moving downward. Higher doses of BRC (5 20 mg/kg) dose-dependently delayed the onset and peak time of yawning. A low dose of the selective D-1 dopamine receptor agonist SK&F38393 did not induce yawning but enhanced the BRC-induced response. Pretreatment with reserpine (1 and 5 mg/kg SC), alpha-MPT (100 and 300 mg/kg IP) and reserpine (1 mg/kg) plus alpha-MPT (100 mg/kg) was able to significantly reduce BRC-induced yawning. The inhibitory effects were prevented by a low dose of SK&F38393 (0.5 mg/kg IP). In particular, combined treatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg) and BRC (10 and 20 mg/kg) elicited upright fighting and jumping behaviors which were inhibited by haloperidol (1 mg/kg IP), a non-selective D-1 and D-2 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg SC). a selective D-1 receptor antagonist, or sulpiride (20 mg/kg IP), a potent D-2 receptor antagonist, and were potentiated by SK&F38393 (0.5 mg/kg). SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg) decreased BRC-induced yawning and the apomorphine (low doses)-induced potentiation of BRC yawning, and prevented the apomorphine (high doses)-induced reduction of BRC yawning. SCH23390 also inhibited apomorphine-induced stereotypy and BRC-induced potentiation of apomorphine stereotypy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Serotonin (5-HT) effects on physostigmine (PHY)-induced yawning were studied in LY Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting Lu 10 171 (citalopram), a specific 5-HT uptake blocker, and two antagonists--methiothepine and ritanserin--which differ slightly in the selectivity of their actions on different 5-HT receptor subtypes. Infant and young rats show significant increases in PHY-induced yawning when preinjected with citalopram (5-10 mg/kg). Two-month-old animals show this effect only with 10 mg/kg. With adult animals (3-5 months old), the effect is the opposite: Yawning decreases. The facilitory effect in infant and young rats was counteracted by methiothepine but not by ritanserin, suggesting that it is mediated through 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes. The inhibitory effect of citalopram in adult rats was unmodified by the two antagonists used, leaving open the possibility that it is mediated by 5-HT3 receptors.\n",
      "1. Bromocriptine (2, 4 and 8 mg kg-1, i.p.), physostigmine (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg kg-1, i.p.) and pilocarpine (1, 3 and 5 mg kg-1, i.p.) induced dose-dependent yawning in rats. 2. These responses were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with morphine. 3. The inhibitory effect of morphine was reversed by naloxone. 4. Naloxone alone induced slight but significant yawning. 5. The present results suggest that morphine inhibits yawning in rats at an opiate receptor downstream from the sites at which cholinoceptor and dopamine D2 activation induce yawning. The anatomical location of these sites remains to be established.\n",

      "The effect of muscimol and baclofen injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine, oxytocin and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) was studied in male rats. Muscimol (20-200 ng), but not baclofen (200 ng), injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus 10 min before apomorphine (50 ng), oxytocin (10 ng) or NMDA (50 ng) reduced penile erection and yawning induced by the above compounds given into the paraventricular nucleus. Bicuculline (250 ng) injected into the paraventricular nucleus 5 min before muscimol (100 ng) prevented the inhibitory effect of muscimol on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine, oxytocin and NMDA. The present results show that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibits penile erection and yawning by acting on GABA(A) receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n",
      "A behavioral study was performed in an attempt to understand the role of central beta-adrenoceptors in yawning in rats. Yawning was evoked by apomorphine and piribedil, mixed dopamine D1/D2-receptor agonists, but not by SK&F 38393 [1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol], a dopamine D1-receptor agonist. The apomorphine-induced yawning was increased by pindolol, propranolol, indenolol, alprenolol and bukumolol which block the central beta-adrenoceptors, but not by the peripheral beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, carteolol and atenolol. These beta-adrenoceptor antagonists given alone did not elicit yawning. Conversely, the yawning was inhibited by salbutamol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, without being affected by prazosin, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. The combined administration of SK&F 38393 and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists did not induce yawning.

From this information, the present study was performed to investigate effects of SND 919 on yawning behavior and prolactin secretion in rats. Subcutaneous injections of SND 919 (25-500 micrograms/kg, s.c.) elicited yawning responses. Its dose-response curve was bell-shaped with maximal effects at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg. Yawning behavior was also evoked by the putative dopamine autoreceptor agonists, talipexole (6-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo [4,5-d]azepine) (B-HT 920) (5-100 micrograms/kg, s.c.) and (+)-3-PPP ((+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine) (5-15 mg/kg, s.c.).

Apo increased yawning compared with placebo when given in the morning (p < 0.02), but not when given in the afternoon. Yawning frequency was increased after both Apo (p < 0.01) and placebo (p < 0.025) when given in the morning compared with responses in the afternoon. These results suggest that yawning frequency with both Apo and placebo is influenced by time of day, possibly as a result of diurnal variation in DA receptor sensitivity.\n",
      "This study investigated whether the indices of dopaminergic function, yawning and growth hormone release induced by apomorphine, as well as the drug-induced nausea and hyperthermia, show sensitization or tolerance to repeated injections. Five normal volunteers received 12 injections of apomorphine hydrochloride (0.75 mg/70 kg) every 2 weeks. Yawning, as measured by the latency of onset and the time of peak activity, showed sensitization. The growth hormone response showed no change. Feelings of nausea and hyperthermia showed tolerance to repeated injections. These findings suggest that yawning may be a suitable index of dopaminergic function in studies of schizophrenia.\n"

      "The systemic administration of the dopamine agonists quinelorane or pergolide to Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) induced a significant increase of locomotor activity at higher doses. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, these compounds induced a significant hypoactivity at low doses, but only a modest, and late, increase in locomotor activity at higher doses. Quinelorane was more potent than pergolide on locomotor activity. In WKY and SHR, which had unilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, quinelorane and pergolide induced similar dose-dependent contralateral turning that, in the case of pergolide, was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. Both quinelorane and pergolide induced yawning similarly in WKY and SHR, and quinelorane was more potent than pergolide. The intravenous administration of quinelorane induced an immediate and dose-dependent increase in blood pressure in WKY and SHR, which could be completely prevented by pretreating the rats with the dopamine antagonist haloperidol. Pergolide similarly caused a rise in blood pressure in WKY and SHR, but its effect could only partially be blocked by haloperidol. The subcutaneous injection of quinelorane or pergolide induced similar dose-dependent hypothermia in WKY. Pergolide also caused a decrease of body temperature in SHR, but quinelorane had little effect in this strain. These results show differences in the effects of quinelorane and pergolide between various experimental test situations and between WKY and SHR. These differences may be related to the involvement of dopamine receptor subtypes and to the previously described changes in central dopaminergic activity in SHR.\n",
      "The enantiomers of the potent and selective dopamine (DA) D-2 receptor agonist 2-(N-propyl-N-thienylethyl-amino)-5-hydroxytetralin, N-0437, were tested for their effects on palatable food consumption and yawning behaviour in rats. (-)-N-0437 (1.0 and 5.0 mumols/kg). This confirms the agonistic action of (-)-N-0437 on postsynaptic receptors as food consumption is considered to be related to stimulation of postsynaptic DA receptors. Yawning behaviour was stimulated by (-)-N-0437 (0.5 mumol/kg) and could be antagonized by the autoreceptor-selective antagonist (+)-UH 232 (25 mumols/kg), which suggests an agonistic action on DA autorecptors. (+)-N-0437 (5.0 and 10.0 mumols/kg) also reduced food consumption and the effect could be antagonized by YM 09151-2 (0.03 mumol/kg). The weaker effect of (+)-N-0437 on food intake in comparison to that induced by (-)-N-0437 can be explained if it assumed that (+)-N-0437 is a partial agonist. (+)-N-0437 did not induce yawning behaviour in rats, suggesting that autoreceptors mediating the release of DA may be involved in stimulating yawning by DA agonists.\n",
      "The effect of i.p. injection of the calcium channel inhibitors, verapamil, flunarizine, nifedipine, nimodipine and nicardipine, on penile erection and yawning induced by the dopamine agonist, apomorphine, or by oxytocin was studied in male rats. The five compounds antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the behavioral responses induced either by apomorphine or oxytocin. Nimodipine and nicardipine were found to be the most potent, being active in doses between 5 and 20 mg/kg, while nifedipine, verapamil and flunarizine were active in doses higher than 15 mg/kg.

      "The ability of acetylcholine muscarinic agonists, injected subcutaneously (s.c.) to elicit yawning and analgesia (tail-flick response) in rats was examined. Yawning was elicited by physostigmine, RS86 and pilocarpine with an inverted 'U'-shaped dose-response relationship; maximal effects occurred at 0.1, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg respectively. Neostigmine (0.05-0.2 mg/kg); arecoline (0.5-2.0 mg/kg); bethanecol (0.1-10 mg/kg) and McN-A-343 (5-20 mg/kg) had marginal or no activity. In contrast, dose-related analgesia was obtained following oxotremorine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) and arecoline (0.5-4.0 mg/kg) and physostigmine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg), RS86 (0.25-2.5 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (0.5-8.0 mg/kg). The effects of acetylcholine antagonists on physostigmine-induced yawning and physostigmine-induced analgesia were also investigated. Following their s.c. injection, trihexyphenidyl, atropine, dicyclomine, secoverine and methylatropine but not pirenzepine, inhibited both yawning and analgesia; there were clear differences in their potencies on the two responses. Pirenzepine, intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), inhibited yawning (ED50 value 5.7 micrograms/rat) but not analgesia (3-100 micrograms/rat).

      "Apomorphine and mCPP induced yawning associated with penile erections in rats, whereas physostigmine induced only yawns. Apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections were antagonized by low doses of raclopride, whereas physostigmine-induced yawning and mCPP-induced effects were only partly inhibited at high doses of raclopride. Scopolamine as well as clozapine antagonized yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine, mCPP and physostigmine. Similarly, the 5-HT1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 inhibited yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine, mCPP and physostigmine, and at similar doses induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling. The beta/5-HT1A antagonist tertatolol reversed the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections and increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency but not penile erection frequency. Like tertatolol, propranolol increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency, whereas ICI 118551 increased only physostigmine-induced yawning. 8-OH-DPAT- and S 14506-induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling were also significantly antagonized by tertatolol. Finally, p-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment produced about 95% depletion in 5-HT in hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex and modified neither the responses of the inducing drugs nor the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "Introduction: Sonotubometry allows an assessment of the Eustachian tube (ET) function under physiological conditions. The application of conventional sinus signals is not reliable enough for routine clinical use. The aim of this study was to investigate ET activity with so-called perfect sequences (PSEQ).\n",
      "Patients and methods: PSEQs generated by a custom-made device were applied in 25 healthy subjects. ET opening was induced by Toynbee manoeuvre, yawning, dry and water swallowing. All sonotubograms were qualitatively analysed according to their shape, and quantitatively according to increase of sound intensity, frequency of opening and opening duration. The sonotubometry results were combined with the patients' perception of tone variation.\n",
      "Results: A number of 400 measurements were performed. In 92.75 % measurements the patients reported ET openings. These were confirmed by 81.5 % valid sonotubograms. The swallowing manoeuvres dry/water swallowing and Toynbee yielded with 94 %/90 % and 93 % valid measurements favourable results. Yawning was associated with 49 % valid measurements. Sound level increase was also significantly different in these manoeuvres when compared to yawning (p < 0.0001). Nasal decongestion had no influence on the results (p > 0.05).\n",
      "Conclusions: PSEQs allow an evaluation of ET function. The chosen manoeuvres trigger in healthy subjects objective ET openings with a high reliability. The application of PSEQs can detect ET activity with a high sensitivity and good specificity. By further technical refinements specificity may also be enhanced in future studies.\n"

      "The potency of several oxytocin-related peptides in inducing penile erection and yawning after injection into a lateral ventricle of male rats was compared. Substitution of two amino acids in the oxytocin molecule or deletion of the C-terminal glycinamide as in des-GlyNH2-oxytocin [oxytocin(1-8)] reduced oxytocin potency in inducing both effects, the rank order being: oxytocin greater than [Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin congruent to isotocin [( Ser4,Ile8]-oxytocin) greater than vasopressin [( Phe3,Arg8]-oxytocin) greater than des-GlyNH2-oxytocin. Oxytocin's ability to induce penile erection and yawning was abolished by permanent opening of the disulfide bridge by reduction and carboxymethylation. Oxytocin(1-6) and oxytocin(7-9) were also inactive. Penile erection and yawning induced by oxytocin-related peptides were antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by nonapeptide antagonists with a rank order of potency that follows their antioxytocic activity (d[(CH2)5Tyr(Me)Orn8]-vasotocin congruent to [Pen1,Phe(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin greater than d[(CH2)5Tyr(Me)Arg8]-vasopression). Carboxymethylated oxytocin, oxytocin(1-6), and oxytocin(7-9) were devoid of antagonistic activity. The present results suggest that central oxytocin receptors mediating the expression of penile erection and yawning are structurally related to those present in the uterus and in the mammary gland.\n",
      "Acute (10 or 20 mg/kg IP) and subchronic (2 x 5 or 10 mg/kg IP daily for 7 days) effects of desipramine, imipramine, maprotiline, (+)- and (-)-oxaprotiline enantiomers as well as selective 5-HT-uptake inhibitors citalopram and ifoxetine on yawning, induced by low doses of apomorphine, were investigated in the rat. In addition, the effects of alpha-1 receptor agonist adrafinil and antagonist prazosin were also tested. After acute treatment, desipramine, the stereoselective NA-uptake inhibiting (+)-enantiomer of oxaprotiline, and the alpha-1 agonist adrafinil, markedly and significantly suppressed yawning. Prazosin, in contrast, clearly potentiated it. This potentiating effect was abolished by the pretreatment with (+)-oxaprotiline and adrafinil. Other drugs were inactive. After subchronic administration, yawning was antagonized by NA-uptake-inhibiting antidepressants, including imipramine and maprotiline. By comparison to the acute treatment, the inhibitory effects of desipramine and (+)-oxaprotiline were considerably enhanced. Neither selective 5-HT-uptake inhibitors nor (-)-oxaprotiline (levoprotiline) were active. Antidepressants therefore modulate the functional activity of D-2 receptors, activated by low doses of apomorphine, predominantly by the virtue of their noradrenergic enhancing properties. This modulatory effect appears to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.\n",
      "Discriminative stimulus effects of direct acting dopamine receptor agonists (e.g. quinpirole) appear to be mediated by D3 receptors in free-feeding rats. Free access to high-fat chow increases sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning, and this study examined whether eating high-fat chow increases sensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects of quinpirole. Five rats discriminated between 0.032 mg/kg quinpirole and vehicle while responding under a continuous reinforcement schedule of stimulus shock termination. When rats had free access to high-fat chow (discrimination training was suspended), the quinpirole discrimination dose-response curve shifted leftward, possibly indicating enhanced sensitivity at D3 receptors. In the same rats, both the ascending (mediated by D3 receptors) and descending (mediated by D2 receptors) limbs of the dose-response curve for quinpirole-induced yawning shifted leftward. When rats had free access to a standard chow (discrimination training was suspended), the quinpirole discrimination and yawning dose-response curves did not change. Together with published data showing that the discriminative stimulus effects of quinpirole in free-feeding rats are mediated by D3 receptors and the insensitivity of this effect of quinpirole to food restriction (shown to increase sensitivity to D2 but not D3-mediated effects), these results suggest that the leftward shift of the discrimination dose-response curve when rats eat high-fat chow is likely because of enhanced sensitivity at D3 receptors. Thus, eating high-fat food enhances drug effects in a manner that might impact clinical effects of drugs or vulnerability to drug abuse.\n",

      "Advancing age produces a noticeable and well-documented decline in erectile function in humans. The effects of aging on the ability of apomorphine to stimulate erection and yawning behavior in rats was studied in our bioassay for potency. At the age of seven months, rats failed to respond to the same dose of apomorphine which, just one month earlier, produced erections. Erectile function was then tested in thirty-two seven-month-old rats naive to apomorphine injections, and these rats also failed to respond. Experimentally naive rats of six months of age were then tested and apomorphine produced reliable erections. It is felt that an alteration in dopamine autoreceptor function may be occurring in the central nervous system of rats at approximately seven months of age rendering them incapable of responding to apomorphine with penile erections.\n",
      "High concentrations of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) have been detected in brain areas containing dopaminergic cell bodies and nerve terminals. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of a proteolytic fragment of DBI, the octadecaneuropeptide ODN, on apomorphine-induced yawning in Sprague-Dawley rats. Injection of graded doses of ODN (12.5 to 100 ng i.c.v.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections. At a dose of 100 ng, intracerebroventricularly administered ODN was able to inhibit, during more than 3 h, the apomorphine-evoked yawning. ODN also inhibited pilocarpine-induced yawning. Apomorphine induces a bell-shaped dose-dependent effect on yawning with a maximum response at the dose of 100 microg/kg and a much lower effect at a dose of 200 microg/kg. Injection (i.c.v.) of 100 ng ODN markedly attenuated the number of yawns induced by 100 microg/kg apomorphine but partially restored the yawning behavior in rats treated with a 200 microg/kg dose of apomorphine. At doses of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg s.c., diazepam did not modify the inhibitory effect of ODN on the apomorphine-induced yawning. Taken together, the present data suggest that ODN inhibits yawning downstream dopaminergic as well as cholinergic synapses involved in yawning. In addition, the effect of ODN cannot be ascribed to an inverse agonistic activity on central-type benzodiazepine receptors.\n",
      "This study was made to separate genetic from postnatal maternal influences on yawning in two strains of Sprague-Dawley rats selected for high- (HY) and low-yawning frequency (LY). Foster mothers of the two strains reared litters of pups in the four possible combinations and yawning was recorded in a novel environment when the adult offspring were 75-day-old. Yawning frequency of males and females was affected by pup strain but not by the strain of the foster mothers, when litter size was made constant; HY adult offspring yawned more than LY adult offspring. Yawning frequency was higher in HY male offspring than in HY female offspring. An interaction term between pup sex and the strain of the foster mothers revealed that while males reared by LY mothers yawned more than males reared by HY mothers, females reared by HY mothers yawned more than females reared by LY mothers. Mean frequency of yawning increased with the sex ratio of HY litters. These findings indicate that genetic and genotype-correlated littermate effects influence yawning frequency of adult offspring in response to a novel environment.\n",
      "We observed a stroke patient with an infarct of the internal capsule interrupting the pyramidal tract who stretched his hemiplegic arm during spontaneous and apomorphine-induced yawning. The putative mechanism by which yawning can induce the paradoxical motor response of the plegic arm in the patient might be the functional efficiency of a pathway projecting directly from the stimulated basal ganglia to lower motor systems in the brainstem.\n"

      "Herein, we evaluate the importance of the nigro-striatal dopamine system in prolactin-, apomorphine-, and physostigmine-induced yawning behavior. Bilateral 6-OH-dopamine lesions of the substantia nigra were performed on male rats (2-4 months old). The lesioned as well as control rats were injected with either physiological saline, physostigmine (200 micrograms/kg), apomorphine (50 micrograms/kg), or ovine prolactin (0.25 micrograms/kg) 72 hours after the surgical procedure. The results show that bilateral lesions of the substantia nigra did not affect physostigmine-induced yawning whereas both apomorphine- and prolactin-induced yawning were reduced by the lesion. Following the observation period the caudate nuclei were removed and analyzed for dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) content. The lesions reduced DA and DOPAC content in all treatment groups compared to the respective intact groups. Also, both DA and DOPAC concentrations were lower in the intact apomorphine and prolactin treated groups compared to intact saline controls, at times that were temporally related to the display of yawning behavior suggesting a decrease in dopamine activity following apomorphine and prolactin treatment. Interestingly, DA and DOPAC concentrations were higher in the lesioned apomorphine group compared to lesioned saline controls; however, in the lesioned prolactin group only the DA concentrations were higher when compared to lesioned saline controls. These results indicate that prolactin- and apomorphine-induced yawning require an intact nigro-striatal dopamine system and that these substances induce yawning by different mechanisms.\n",
      "The influence on rat-feeding behavior of B-HT 920 (a selective agonist of D2DA receptors at low doses, but also a potent stimulant of alpha 2-adrenoceptors at high doses) was examined using a new experimental model. The apparatus adopted was an X-maze with alternate open and covered arms, each baited with two food-pellets. Individual rats were placed in the apparatus and observed for 5 min. Two essential aspects of rat behavior in the presence of food were considered: tasting and feeding. A number of parameters were recorded: latency to tasting and feeding; interval between tasting and feeding; total feeding time. We also took into account the type of arm in which the rats indulged in their first bout of tasting and feeding. In the first series of experiments, B-HT 920 was injected intraperitoneally (0.1, 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg) into fed and fasted rats; in the second series, the drug was injected intracerebroventricularly (10, 20 and 80 micrograms/rat) into fasted rats. In both experimental conditions, the drug significantly modified the animals' feeding behavior and affected their natural preference for the closed arms as places of choice in which to feed. Comparison of the results with those obtained using norepinephrine (20 micrograms/rat, intracerebroventricularly), a well-known hyperphagic agent, shows that B-HT 920 strongly stimulates feeding. Also, the results of the intracerebroventricular experiments confirm that the effect on feeding appears at doses that are active both on alpha 2-adrenoceptors and on D2DA receptors, as can be deduced from penile erection and stretching and yawning elicited in rats by the same D2DA stimulant doses. The involvement of the latter receptors in feeding has been investigated by means of a new series of experiments with rats treated with the D2DA antagonist sulpiride, before B-HT 920 at 100 micrograms/kg. The possible mechanisms underlying B-HT 920-hyperphagic effects and the value of the X-maze feeding test as a simple procedure indicative of changes in rat feeding and emotionality are discussed in the light of these latest findings.\n",

      "A behavioral study was performed in an attempt to understand the effect of age (rats aged 2, 6, 12, 18, or 24 months) on the dopaminergic-cholinergic neuronal mechanism involved in yawning and stereotyped behaviors induced by dopaminergic and cholinergic drugs. Intraperitoneal (ip) injection of a low dose of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg), which preferentially activates presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, produced a lower frequency of yawning responses in 12- and 24-month-old rats than in 2-month-old rats. A high dose of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) which stimulates both pre- and post-synaptic dopamine receptors produced the most pronounced stereotyped behavior in 12-month-old rats. The peak times for apomorphine-induced stereotypy shifted to the right between 2- and 12- and 24-month-old rats, and the duration of the stereotypy also increased in 12- and 24-month-old rats as compared with 2-month-old rats. It is suggested that decreased function of the presynaptic dopamine receptors might contribute to the increased stereotypy induced by apomorphine with increasing age in the rat. Yawning responses induced by pilocarpine (4 mg/kg) were reduced in 6- to 24-month-old rats whereas those by physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg) were not affected in rats of any age. These results suggest that differential pathways are involved in dopaminergic-cholinergic neuronal interaction, and that with increasing age, cholinergic neurons activated by cholinesterase inhibition (endogenous acetylcholine) were not affected but those by a direct acetylcholine agonist (muscarinic M-1 receptor agonist) were diminished.\n",
      "Dose-dependent effects of 7-OH-PIPAT and PD-128,907 on motor behaviors and place conditioning were examined in rats. Four 2-day conditioning trials were conducted over 8 consecutive days. On one day of each trial, animals received an injection of either saline, one of six doses of 7-OH-PIPAT (0.01-10.0 mg/kg), or one of five doses of PD-128,907 (0.01-1.0 mg/kg), and were placed into a distinct compartment for 40 min. On the other day, animals received an injection of saline and were placed into a different compartment for 40 min. Locomotion, sniffing, and yawning were measured following the first and last drug injections. Place conditioning was assessed the day following the last conditioning trial. None of the doses of 7-OH-PIPAT or 0-0.3 mg/kg PD-128,907 produced place conditioning. However, 1 mg/kg PD-128,907 produced conditioned place preference (CPP). Across doses, both 7-OH-PIPAT and PD-128,907 produced a U-shaped change in sniffing and locomotion and an inverted U-shaped change in yawning. Across time, lower doses produced a decrease in sniffing and locomotion and an increase in yawning that were evident immediately, whereas higher doses produced a biphasic change in that there was an initial decrease followed by an increase in sniffing and locomotion. Behaviors produced by both low and high doses were sensitized following repeated administration. PD-128,907 produced CPP and was more potent than 7-OH-PIPAT in altering motor behaviors, possibly due to its greater selectivity for the D3 receptor.\n",
      "Facial electromyography (EMG) coupled with visual observation was used to investigate spontaneous and drug induced perioral movements in freely moving rats. Four separate perioral behaviours were identified; facial tremor, purposeless chewing, gaping and yawning. Facial tremor, yawning and gaping but not purposeless chewing produced characteristic EMG signals. Normal rats displayed a low level of purposeless chewing, occasional bursts of facial tremor but not gaping or yawning. Each burst of facial tremor was accompanied by a transient increase in purposeless chewing. Administration of the D1 agonist SKF 38393 induced a dose related increase in bursts of facial tremors and consequently an increase in the total number of purposeless chews. Gaping and yawning were not induced by SKF 38393 administration. Administration of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) induced a dose related increase in the total number of purposeless chews, but primarily these were not associated with facial tremor. Administration of physostigmine also increased gaping and yawning. Administration of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 almost abolished facial tremor in normal treated rats but only partially reduced that induced by SKF 38393 and physostigmine. SCH 23390 reduced purposeless chewing in SKF 38393 treated rats but not in normal or physostigmine treated animals. Administration of the cholinergic antagonist atropine almost abolished facial tremor in normal and physostigmine treated rats, but only reduced by 46% that induced by SKF 38393. Atropine reduced purposeless chewing in normal, physostigmine and SKF 38393 treated animals. Physostigmine induced gaping and yawning were abolished by atropine administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n"

      "7-OH-DPAT ((+/-)-2-(dipropylamino)-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) was recently identified as a dopamine receptor agonist having a > 100-, 1,000- and > 10,000-fold higher affinity for dopamine D3 than for D2, D4 and D1 receptors, respectively. Quinpirole (LY 171555) has also been reported to have a 113-fold greater affinity for dopamine D3 receptors than for D2 receptors. Therefore, we investigated the effects of these putative dopamine D3 receptor agonists on yawning, stereotypy and rectal temperature in rats (N = 424). 7-OH-DPAT and quinpirole administered subcutaneously (SC) at respective low doses of 10-250 micrograms/kg and 25-500 micrograms/kg elicited yawning behavior. The yawning induced by these agents was blocked by spiperone (0.5 mg/kg, SC) and scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, SC) but was increased by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of pindolol (20 mg/kg). The yawning was also potentiated after treatment with reserpine. 7-OH-DPAT and quinpirole at respective high doses of 0.25 mg/kg (SC) and 0.5 mg/kg (SC) evoked slight stereotypy such as sniffing and licking, and this effect was enhanced by a selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SK&F 38393 (1-phenyl-2,3,4,5,-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol). 7-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, SC) and quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg, SC) decreased, but SK&F 38393 (10 mg/kg, SC) increased body temperature. However, the hyperthermia induced by SK&F 38393 was interestingly enhanced by 7-OH-DPAT and quinpirole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "This study served to examine the differential effects of age (rats aged 2 or 12 months) on behavioral responses induced by bromocriptine and apomorphine. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of bromocriptine or apomorphine produced a lower frequency of yawning responses, in 12-month-old rats than in 2-month-old rats. Apomorphine produced a more pronounced stereotyped behavior in 12-month-old rats than in 2-month-old rats. Apomorphine, at 0.1 mg/kg administered after bromocriptine (1.0-20 mg/kg) potentiated yawning behavior. The frequency of yawning in 2-month-old rats was pronounced at 2.5 mg/kg of bromocriptine but only at 5 mg/kg 12-month-old rats. Apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg) did not produce perioral behavior in 2-month-old rats but did in 12-month-old rats. The apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg)-induced stereotypy was stimulated dose dependently by bromocriptine in 2-month-old-rats but not in 12-month-old rats. Bromocriptine did not produce this behavior when administered alone. Pretreatment of 2-month-old rats with reserpine, a catecholamine depletor, plus alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, inhibited the yawning induced by bromocriptine but potentiated that induced by apomorphine. Such treatment did not significantly alter either bromocriptine or apomorphine-induced yawning responses in 12-month-old rats. The apomorphine-induced stereotypy in 2-month-old rats was markedly potentiated by catecholamine depletion but was not affected in 12-month-old rats. These results suggest that the increasing effect on stereotypy and decreasing effects on yawning in the 12-month-old rats seem to result in an alteration of potency and of the ratio of D-2 versus D-1 receptor activity.\n",
      "The granular gland skin secretion of Xenopus laevis induces seven involuntary oral dyskinesias and climbing behavior in the water snake Nerodia sipedon. In a previous study the D-2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol (HAL), selectively potentiated mucus-induced yawning and chewing but attenuated fixed gaping; other oral behaviors were unaffected; HAL alone induced no dyskinesias and failed to modify mucus-induced decreases in tongue flicking, cage climbing and activity. As skin compounds have neuroleptic properties known to induce human and animal dyskinesias, we hypothesized that D-1 receptor antagonism may modulate the four of seven mucus-induced dyskinesias and the climbing not altered by HAL. We found that, like HAL, SCH 23390 (SCH) potentiated mucus-induced yawning, attenuated fixed gaping and had no effect on climbing. Unlike HAL's potentiation of chewing, SCH attenuated chewing and potentiated writhing tongue movements. SCH alone, like skin mucus, attenuated tongue flicking and activity but, given with mucus, SCH increased tongue flicking and activity to control levels. Compared to the HAL study, results suggest that mucus-induced yawning and fixed gaping are similarly modulated by both HAL and SCH, while these drugs have opposite effects on writhing tongue and chewing. SCH given alone or with frog mucus had unique effects on activity and normal tongue flicking.\n",
      "1. The effects of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine and the activator Bay K 8644 were investigated in different behavioural tests involving dopaminergic systems. These were the discriminative stimulus induced by amphetamine, rotational behaviour in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions and apomorphine-induced yawning in rats. 2. The yawning induced by apomorphine (40 micrograms kg-1 s.c.) was significantly potentiated by nifedipine (5-10 mgkg-1 i.p.). Bay K 8644 (0.05-0.5 mgkg-1 i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited yawning induced by apomorphine (80 micrograms kg-1 s.c.) and, at 0.4 mgkg-1, inhibited the nifedipine potentiation of apomorphine-induced yawning. In contrast to their effects on apomorphine-induced yawning, nifedipine and Bay K 8644 had no effect on apomorphine-induced penile erection. 3. Bay K 8644 (0.06-0.5 mgkg-1 i.p.) and nifedipine (5-20 mgkg-1 i.p.) had no dose-related effect on the discrimination performance of rats trained to discriminate amphetamine from saline. However, nifedipine dose-dependently reduced the response rate of amphetamine-treated rats. Bay K 8644 had no effect on this measure except at high doses that also caused disruption. 4. Neither nifedipine (5-10 mgkg-1 i.p.) nor Bay K 8644 (0.06-0.5 mgkg-1 i.p.) affected the turning behaviour induced by amphetamine (1 mgkg-1 i.p.) in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the medial forebrain bundle, and did not induce turning themselves. 5. As the dihydropyridine compounds affected apomorphine-induced yawning but not penile erection, and did not affect amphetamine-induced rotation or drug discrimination, it seems unlikely that they are affecting dopamine release in vivo.\n",
      "Sensorimotor function and the behavioural responses to a range of doses of subcutaneous apomorphine were assessed in mature (6-8 months) and old (23-26 months) Sprague-Dawley rats of comparable weight. In addition, the locomotor activity response of 12-month-old and 24-month-old rats to continuous infusions (14 days by osmotic minipump) of a selective dopamine D2 agonist. (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (PHNO, 10 micrograms/h) was investigated. Measures of spontaneous locomotor activity and motor coordination revealed impairments in the aged animals. Low doses of apomorphine (10-50 micrograms/kg), which preferentially activate dopamine autoreceptors, induced yawning, chewing mouth movements and penile grooming. The frequency of yawning and duration of penile grooming were significantly decreased in the old animals. In contrast, 200 micrograms/kg of apomorphine induced stereotyped sniffing and licking or gnawing, and these responses were significantly increased in the aged animals. There was a 25% decrease in striatal dopamine levels in the aged animals in this experiment. PHNO increased the amplitude of the circadian rhythms in locomotor activity exhibited by mature rats, and daytime tolerance to the stimulant effects of PHNO was reversed by stress in these animals. Both of these effects were attenuated in the aged rats. These findings suggest that (1) the dopamine receptors mediating yawning and stereotypy have different anatomical locations (2) ageing is associated with decreased responsiveness to stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors, consequent upon the loss of dopaminergic nerve terminals, and (3) while the functional response to selective stimulation of postsynaptic D2 receptors decreases with age, the postsynaptic response to a mixed D1/D2 agonist increases.\n",
      "The present study was undertaken to determine the state of sensitivity of dopamine D2/D3 receptors involved in the mediation of yawning behaviour at various times following acute morphine administration to rats. Morphine (3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) induced a biphasic effect on locomotor activity: an initial inhibitory phase lasting for about 30 min was after about an hour followed by a phase of locomotor activation lasting for about 60 min. Dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist quinpirole (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) induced yawning behaviour in rats. Morphine given at 15 or 60 min before (inhibitory phase) inhibited the yawning response to quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg) but not when given at 90 or 120 min before (stimulatory phase). Naloxone (1.0 mg/kg) given 10 min before quinpirole restored yawning inhibited by morphine pretreatment during the inhibitory phase (15-60 min after morphine). However, during the morphine-induced stimulatory phase naloxone strongly inhibited the yawning response to quinpirole. D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 [R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3- benzazepin-7-ol hemimaleate] at 0.01 mg/kg did not affect quinpirole-induced yawning or its inhibition by morphine. However, in rats which received morphine 90 min prior to testing yawning, SCH 23390 enhanced quinpirole-induced yawning behaviour as compared with morphine- or saline-pretreated animals. The data obtained in the present study indicate that morphine pretreatment initially induces a lack of responsiveness of the D2/D3 receptors mediating yawning behaviour and subsequently increases their sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n"

      "The effect of the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, two inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, on penile erection and yawning induced by 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazine (m-CPP)- and N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (TFMPP), two selective 5HT1c receptor agonists, was studied in male rats. Both NO synthase inhibitors (50-500 micrograms i.c.v.) prevented dose-dependently the behavioural responses induced by m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) or by TFMPP (1 mg/kg s.c.), but NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was about 4-5 times more potent than NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. The D-isomer of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, which does not inhibit nitric oxide synthase, was ineffective. The inhibitory effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester on m-CPP- and TFMPP-induced responses was prevented by the administration of L-arginine (1 mg i.c.v.). In contrast, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (20 micrograms) was ineffective when injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, a brain area that plays a key role in the expression of these behavioural responses. m-CPP- and TFMPP-induced penile erection and yawning was prevented also by the i.c.v. administration of LY 83583 (50-200 micrograms) or methylene blue (50-400 micrograms), two inhibitors of guanylate cyclase but not by reduced hemoglobin (50-400 micrograms), a NO scavenger. The results suggest that central nitric oxide is involved in the expression of penile erection and yawning induced by 5-HT1c receptor agonists.\n",

Haloperidol in a dose of 10 micrograms/kg had no significant effects on the SNC neurons. R(-)apomorphine (cumulative i.v. dose of 40 micrograms/kg, given as: 5, 5, 10 and 20 micrograms/kg) inhibited the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons, in a dose-dependent manner. Haloperidol (cumulative i.v. dose of 10 micrograms/kg, as: 2.5, 2.5 and 5 micrograms/kg) reversed the effect of apomorphine. Complete reversal of the firing rate to haloperidol was observed with a dose of 10 micrograms/kg. In rats pretreated with 10 micrograms/kg of haloperidol, there was a dramatic shift to the right of the apomorphine dose-response curve (cumulative i.v. dose of 800 micrograms/kg, as: 50, 50, 100, 200 and 400 micrograms/kg), and this inhibition was reversed by haloperidol (cumulative i.v. dose of 400 micrograms/kg, as: 50, 50, 100 and 200 micrograms/kg). Apomorphine in doses of 40 micrograms/kg and 800 micrograms/kg elicited yawning behavior and stereotypy, respectively. Apomorphine in a dose of 800 micrograms/kg elicited stereotypy in rats treated 3 min before with 10 micrograms/kg of haloperidol. Therefore, electrophysiological determinations of events in the SNC dopaminergic neurons are given support by the behavior observed in these rats.\n",
      "The intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of oxytocin at doses between 5 and 100 ng induced repeated episodes of penile erection and yawning, while at doses between 100 ng and 10 micrograms it induced motor disturbances often culminating in barrel rotation in rats. The intensity of motor disturbances was inversely correlated to the number of yawning and penile erection episodes. Pretreatment with the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine (80 and 240 micrograms/kg SC) failed to modify the incidence of motor disturbance induced by high doses of oxytocin, but markedly reduced the intensity of the symptomatology in a dose-dependent manner. The present results suggest that high doses of oxytocin induce motor disturbances which mask penile erection and yawning, and that brain dopaminergic systems have a protective role against this symptomatology.\n",
      "The intracerebroventricular administration of ACTH1-24 (3-5 micrograms/rat) produced a behavioural syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of penile erection and yawning in rats. Hypophysectomy prevented ACTH1-24-induced yawning and penile erection. These results suggest that pituitary has a \"trophic\" action not only on peripheral target organs but also on structures in brain controlling specific behavioural responses.\n",

      "Young adult male rats were implanted with a push-pull cannula aimed at the dorsal and rostral areas of the caudate nucleus. Perfusate samples were collected at two-minute intervals for approximately one hour and assayed for DOPAC concentrations. Simultaneously, yawning, penile erections and grooming behavior were recorded. Yawns were induced by systemic prolactin or apomorphine injections. While mean DOPAC efflux was elevated following prolactin (PRL) and apomorphine decreased mean DOPAC efflux as expected, yawns and penile erections induced by both compounds were associated with rapid momentary decreases in DOPAC efflux in these living animals. Although yawning was associated with significant decreases in DOPAC output, not every momentary DOPAC decrease was associated with a yawn, suggesting that the 'yawning generator' most likely requires additional inputs for the expression of a yawn.\n",
      "The effect of scopolamine hydrobromide (0.4 mg s.c.) on spontaneous yawning was studied in 16 male volunteers in a double-blind study. Scopolamine (or placebo) was given 60 min before (-60 min) placebo (physiological saline s.c.) (time 0 min) and yawning monitored from -15 to +60 min by recording displacement of the lower jaw and storing the traces on diskettes. After placebo, the number of yawns was 5.3 +/- 1.4 (means +/- SE) and after scopolamine pretreatment 4.3 +/- 1.6 (p = NS). Drowsiness was assessed with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and the Analog Sleepiness Scale at -15, 0, +20, +40, +60 min. There was no significant correlation between total sleepiness scores (area under the curve, 0 min to +60 min), peak sleepiness score or peak increment in sleepiness score and number of yawns on either scale. These data suggest that (a) spontaneous yawning in man is not mediated by a central muscarinic cholinergic link, and (b) the assumed relationship between drowsiness and yawning remains to be verified experimentally.\n",

      "Previous studies have shown that dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers can potentiate yawning induced by apomorphine in rats. The present study was undertaken to examine whether or not this interaction was seen with other compounds that induce yawning or if it represented a specific interaction with dopaminergic mechanisms. Yawning induced by apomorphine (40 micrograms/kg SC), physostigmine (50 micrograms/kg SC) or pilocarpine (1 mg/kg SC) was dose-dependently potentiated by the DHP calcium channel blocker nifedipine (1.25-10 mg/kg IP). Nimodipine (1.25-5 mg/kg IP) and nitrendipine (1.25-5 mg/kg IP) also significantly increased the yawning response. The DHP calcium channel blockers alone induced only a low incidence of yawning. The effects of nifedipine on physostigmine-induced yawning were reversed by the DHP calcium channel activator BAY K 8644 which also inhibited yawning induced by physostigmine (100 micrograms/kg SC) and pilocarpine (2 mg/kg SC). In contrast to the DHP compounds, diltiazem (2.5-10 mg/kg IP) and verapamil (2.5-10 mg/kg IP) failed to potentiate yawning. Sulpiride (10 mg/kg SC) antagonised the nifedipine potentiation of apomorphine-induced yawning but not that of physostigmine-induced yawning; atropine (2.5 mg/kg SC) antagonised both effects. These results support the hypothesis that this effect of dihydropyridine compounds is not dependent on, nor mediated through, dopaminergic mechanisms.\n",
      "Yawning in male rats is a behavior that may be induced by a group of dopamine receptors when low doses of dopamine-receptor agonists are administered. To determine whether agonist treatments during postnatal development could produce a long-lived supersensitization of these dopamine receptors, rats were treated daily for the first 28 days from birth with quinpirole HCl (3.0 mg/kg/day, IP), an agonist that acts at D2 and D3 receptors. At 8 to 10 weeks from birth the dose-effect curve for quinpirole-induced yawning demonstrated that a supersensitization of dopamine receptors for yawning behavior had occurred. Yawning at the optimal dose of quinpirole HCl (100 microgram/kg, IP) was increased 2-fold. The Bmax and Kd for D2 receptor binding in rat striatum were unaltered in this group of rats. These findings indicate that dopamine receptors can be ontogenically \"primed\" or supersensitized, and that the phenomenon apparently is not related to changes in striatal D2 receptor binding characteristics.\n"

      "Apomorphine-induced yawning was completely suppressed in animals treated with 5 nmol [D-Pro4]casomorphin (CM) (ICV), 10 nmol [D-Phe3]CM (ICV) or 10 nmol [D-Pip4]CM (ICV). The apomorphine-induced yawning was also decreased, by des-Tyr analogs, but only by about 50%. Physostigmine (0.15 mg/kg, IP) induced yawning. The physostigmine-induced yawning was suppressed by 5 nmol [D-Pro4]CM and 10 nmol [D-Phe3]CM. Both [des-Tyr-D-Phe3]CM and [des-Tyr-D-Pip4]CM were without effect, whereas [des-Tyr-D-Pro4]CM increased significantly the physostigmine-induced yawning. The results suggest that dopaminergic transmission can be modulated by beta-casomorphin derivatives, thus resulting in a decrease in yawning. In the case of the des-tyrosine derivatives, we can assume a dopaminergic modulation, too. An increase in serotonergic activity might be supposed for [des-Tyr-D-Pro4]CM.\n",
      "In the present work, adenosine agonists and antagonists on apomorphine-induced yawning in rats was investigated. Subcutaneous (SC) injection of apomorphine (0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) induced dose-dependent yawning behaviour in rats. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of different doses of the drug (1, 3, 5 micrograms/rat) also caused a dose-related yawning. ICV administration of the adenosine receptor agonists 5-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) decreased apomorphine-induced yawning. The response induced by the adenosine agonists was reduced by 8-phenyladenosine (8-PT) pretreatment. The yawning induced by SC and ICV administration of apomorphine was decreased by ICV or IP injection of theophylline, respectively. It is concluded that at least A1 adenosine receptors may exert negative influence on the apomorphine-induced yawning. However, the exact mechanism(s) of adenosine receptors in this behaviour remain to be established.\n",

      "The effects of chronic treatment with the selective D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.25 mg kg-1 s.c. twice daily for 18 days, 4 days withdrawal on yawning induced by the D2-receptor agonist quinpirole has been investigated. Low doses of quinpirole (20 and 50 micrograms kg-1 s.c.) induced dose-related yawning behaviour in rats. The yawning response to quinpirole was not significantly different in the presence or absence of SCH 23390 pretreatment. However, chronic treatment with SCH 23390 alone significantly suppressed yawning behaviour. The results suggest that chronic D1-receptor blockade with SCH 23390 does not alter the function of the D2-receptor population mediating yawning behaviour. However, after withdrawal it may result in behavioural activation as seen by suppression of yawning behaviour in the present study.\n",

      "Four week swim exercise schedule (45 min day-1, 6 days each week) in rats led to a significant adaptive change in functional responsiveness of dopamine receptors (auto-receptors) in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic system that was evident from the modification of behavioural responses elicited by a low dose of apomorphine, a direct acting dopamine receptor agonist. Thus, a remarkable increase in yawning response, development of full blown stereotypy, as well as profound attenuation of locomotory and hypothermic response was observed in exercise-trained rats as compared with the non-exercise group (control), following intraperitoneal administration of 0.3 mg kg-1 of apomorphine.\n",

      "Repeated treatment in ontogeny with the dopamine (DA) D(2)/D(3) receptor agonist quinpirole is associated with enhanced quinpirole-induced yawning and other behaviors such as vacuous chewing, vertical jumping, and antinociception. To determine if the reputedly DA D(3) agonist (+/-)-2-(dipropylamino)-7-hydroxy-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydronaphthalene (7-OH-DPAT) would prime for yawning in a manner analogous to that for quinpirole, rats were treated for the first 11 days after birth with an equimolar dose of either quinpirole or 7-OH-DPAT (195.4 nmol/kg/day) and tested for agonist-induced yawning in adulthood. While enhanced quinpirole-induced and 7-OH-DPAT-induced yawning was observed in quinpirole-primed rats, acute treatments with quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT did not produce an enhanced yawing response in 7-OH-DPAT-\"primed\" rats. Our findings indicate that 7-OH-DPAT, unlike quinpirole, does not prime for quinpirole- or 7-OH-DPAT-induced yawning in rats.\n",

      "This study analysed the effect of the intracerebroventricular administration of bombesin (BN) at doses of 0.001, 0.005, 0.1 and 1.0 microg/2 microl on yawning, grooming and other behavioral correlates in two inbred strains of male rats. These were selected for high-yawning (HY) and low-yawning (LY) frequency, a difference that correlates with novelty-induced grooming. Grooming increased with BN in a strain-specific manner, and yawning decreased in HY rats. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that rats' behaviors changed from yawning to grooming with BN. Such change differed between the strains. While the first principal component was dominated by grooming in both strains, the second principal component was dominated by stretching and penile erections in HY rats, and by scratching in LY rats. While LY rats spent more time in scratching both within and outside grooming bouts, HY rats tended to favour the latter category. An increment in mean duration of grooming bouts characterized the effect of the highest dose. These findings show that BN inhibits yawning and increases grooming, suggesting that this peptide enhances the initial response to novel environments. The study shows the importance of combining studies on inbred strains with appropriate multivariate methods to separate drug-induced behavioral patterns.\n",
      "An elderly hemiplegic patient participating in an EMG biofeedback training program was observed to produce a synergistic flexion movement of the plegic (determined by functional evaluations) upper limb while yawning. In the course of the training sessions the electrical activity of the anterior deltoid (the target muscle) was recorded during yawning. These peak EMG values were greatly facilitated in comparison with the session mean peak values obtained during an attempted maximum voluntary isometric contraction (shoulder flexion) of the same limb (e.g., Trial 1: 85.00 vs. 4.33 microV). The possibility of yawning as a confounding variable in EMG biofeedback studies is presented and discussed.\n",
      "Yawning behavior is an experimental tool to study physiological responses, to elucidate the mechanisms of action of some drugs and hormones, and it is also a paradigm for some diseases and for dopamine (DA) agonists' clinical use. In this study, the effects of 24- and 48-h fasting as well as the influence of the light-dark cycle on apomorphine (APO)-induced yawning were evaluated. Initially, control and 48-h-fasted adult male rats were tested for yawning induced by APO (50, 100, 150 micrograms/kg, SC). The most effective dose tested was 100 micrograms/kg. Fasting significantly lowered yawning in all doses tested. Comparison between 24- and 48-h-fasted rats for APO (100 micrograms/kg)-induced yawning showed no significant difference between groups. Ad lib-fed groups were tested for APO (100 micrograms/kg)-induced yawning in both the light and in the dark phases of the cycle. Total number of yawnings increased significantly in the dark period. The present data show that fasting reduces and dark period increases APO-induced yawning in rats, suggesting that these conditions modulate the expression of this behavior.\n",

Three doses of apomorphine (31.25, 62.50 and 125 micrograms/kg) were subcutaneously administered two hours after LHRH 100 micrograms/kg or solvent SC treatment. Apomorphine induced repeated episodes of yawning and genital grooming. Pretreatment with LHRH abolished or reduced yawning and genital grooming induced by the three doses of apomorphine, suggesting that the peptide could induce subsensitivity of DA receptors responsible for yawning and genital grooming.\n"

      "The penile erection-inducing effect of intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected adrenocorticotropin-(1-24) [ACTH-(1-24)] (4 or 10 microg/animal) was almost completely absent in diabetic rats, either 8 days or 2 months after streptozotocin administration. The other behavioral symptoms (stretching, yawning, excessive grooming) were unevenly affected: stretching was significantly reduced either in early or in long-standing diabetes; yawning was practically absent in early diabetes and significantly reduced at the highest dose of ACTH-(1-24) in long-standing diabetes; grooming was reduced only at the highest dose of ACTH-(1-24), both in early and in long-standing diabetes. The fact that ACTH-induced penile erections (a centrally mediated effect) are practically absent even a few days after streptozotocin injection suggests that diabetes mellitus-induced penile dysfunction occurs, at least in part, through central mechanisms, and is not solely the consequence of peripheral nerve and vascular lesions.\n",
      "Because stressful manipulations have been reported to modify drug-induced yawning, the present study investigated the effects of single and repeated treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEXA) on apomorphine- and pilocarpine-induced yawning in male rats. Neither single nor repeated treatment with DEXA altered apomorphine-induced yawning. Single administration of DEXA, however, resulted in an increased number of yawns induced by pilocarpine. Conversely, repeated administration of DEXA led to a decreased number of yawns induced by pilocarpine. In conclusion, the present findings show that dopaminergic and cholinergic are distinctly altered by DEXA, in terms of yawning behavior when animals received DEXA.\n",
      "This study was designed to determine how to suppress behavioral effects of androgens with a pure non-steroidal antiandrogen, Hydroxyflutamide (OHF). The major dependent variable was yawning behavior of castrated adult male rhesus macaques. Injections of testosterone propionate (TP) increased yawning frequency and cessation of TP injections produced a decrease in yawning frequency. A similar decrease was observed with simultaneous injections of TP and OHF. It has been found that the dose of OHF injected subcutaneously should be 80 times that of TP to block the effects of either physiological or supraphysiological doses of TP.\n",
      "Subcutaneous injection of B-HT 920, a dopamine D2-receptor agonist, in doses ranging from 5 to 100 micrograms/kg, induced yawning behavior in rats. Yawning was also elicited by low doses (25-500 micrograms/kg sc) of SND 919, a newly synthesized dopamine receptor agonist. The yawning evoked by B-HT 920 or SND 919 was increased by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol (20 mg/kg ip) which alone did not induce yawning. Stereotyped behavior did not appear after B-HT 920 or SND 919 given alone or in combination with pindolol. The results suggest that SND 919 as well as B-HT 920 has stimulatory activity at dopamine D2-receptors, and that pindolol may exert its enhancement of the yawning response to dopamine receptor agonists via blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.\n",
      "We investigated the effect of sleep and sighing on supratracheal resistance in unrestrained mongrel dogs breathing through the nose by comparing within-breath changes in upper airway pressure-flow relationship in control, sigh, and five postsigh breaths recorded during wakefulness and during non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep. A sigh breath was characterized by a high tidal volume and was typically followed by an apnea of a variable duration. Sleep had little or no effect on supratracheal resistance, measured at peak flow rates, during quiet breathing (awake 7.3 +/- 0.4, non-rapid eye movement 8.3 +/- 0.4, and rapid eye movement 6.8 +/- 0.4 cmH2O.l-1.s). The resistance was identical in the early part of inspiration in control and sigh breaths but increased during the augmented phase of sigh breaths. Resistance at peak inspiratory flow was higher in sigh breaths than in control breaths in all sleep states. The flow-pressure profile of postsigh breaths was identical to that of control breaths in all sleep states. We conclude that upper airway resistance is essentially unaffected by sleep state in the mongrel dog and that sighing increases upper airway resistance regardless of sleep state.\n",
      "Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, causes yawning in rats. It has been suggested that the analysis of yawning behavior provides an index of dopamine autoreceptor function. Dopamine turnover in the substantia nigra of diabetic rats has been shown to be decreased following administration of amphetamine or apomorphine (17,21). Yawning behavior after 4 weeks of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in Wistar rats was significantly lowered when compared with their age-matched normal controls. Yawning behavior was not further diminished after an 8-week duration of diabetes mellitus; however, a significant recovery in yawning was seen by 20 weeks of diabetes. Yawning in rats after 20 weeks of STZ-induced diabetes mellitus is not significantly different from that seen in normal control rats. The results suggest that in STZ-induced diabetes of only 4 weeks duration a measurable change in the substrate for yawning has occurred.\n",
      "Apomorphine-induced yawning was studied in male rats with bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra. Apomorphine 10, 20 and 50 micrograms/kg SC induced dose-dependent yawning in unoperated controls and animals with sham lesions. In the lesioned animals (in which the mean striatal dopamine depletion was 67%), the maximum yawning response rate was greatly attenuated with no evidence that the dose response curve was shifted in either direction. Furthermore, blockade of yawning in the lesioned animals was not simply due to suppression by other stereotyped behaviours, since there was no evidence of increased sniffing or chewing in these animals. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that apomorphine-induced yawning is mediated by dopamine autoreceptors and requires intact nigrostriatal projections.\n",
      "The effect of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on physostigmine-induced yawning was investigated in intact or cannulated rats. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of physostigmine to rats induced yawning dose dependently. I.p. or i.c.v. treatment of the animals with atropine, theophylline, 5-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) or N6-cyclohexyladenosine reduced the yawning induced by i.p. injection of physostigmine. I.p. administration of theophylline decreased the yawning induced by i.c.v. injection of physostigmine. The inhibitory action of N6-cyclohexyladenosine (i.p.) also was decreased by 8-phenyltheophylline (i.p.) pretreatment. It is concluded that yawning induced by a central cholinergic mechanism and a central adenosine mechanism interacts with the cholinergic-induced behaviour.\n",
      "We studied immediate and delayed effects of intraventricular injection of 1,2-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride on behavioral reactions in rats.

      "CQ 32-084 and CQP 201-403, two ergot derivatives that previous behavioural studies in rats had suggested to be differently active on dopamine (DA) receptors, were IP injected into male chickens. Both compounds strongly modified the animals' behaviour. CQ 32-084 led to sedation, increased yawning, and decreased preening, while CQP 201-403 exerted a biphasic activity: At a low dose, it elicited sedation and yawning; at high doses, however, it induced a state of excitation manifested by diminished sedation and yawning, enhanced preening, and pecking. The sedation, increased yawning, and decreased preening induced by the two DA agonists were reversed by the D2-selective antagonist, sulpiride. The present studies indicate that, from a behavioural point of view, chickens respond similarly to rats to the DA agonists CQ 32-084 and CQP 201-403, which differ in their selectivity of action on the various DA receptor subtypes.\n"

      "Previous experiments have shown that the potentiation of physostigmine-induced yawning by nifedipine is abolished by sham-lesioning procedures in rats, whereas the nifedipine potentiation of apomorphine-induced yawning is unaffected. The present results demonstrate that either the presurgical drug treatment (desmethylimipramine and pentobarbital) or 7 days isolation was alone sufficient to reduce the yawning response to physostigmine and abolish its potentiation by nifedipine. The sham-lesioned rats responded normally to a combination of apomorphine and nifedipine. These results suggest that the stress associated with standard operative procedures can differentially affect drug interactions with yawning induced by either apomorphine or physostigmine and that caution should be exercised when interpreting results from animals that have been similarly stressed.\n",

      "The present experiments were performed to investigate differences in the properties of the dopamine D-2 receptors related to yawning and stereotypy. Subcutaneous injection of talipexole (B-HT 920) (10-250 micrograms/kg) or SND 919 ((S)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-propylamino-benzothiazole) (25-500 micrograms/kg) evoked yawning behavior with bell-shaped responses. However, SK&F 38393 (1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol) (0.5-10 mg/kg SC) did not elicit yawning and decreased yawning responses to low doses of talipexole (25 micrograms/kg SC) or SND 919 (100 micrograms/kg SC). These low but effective doses for inducing yawning of talipexole or SND 919 in combination with SK&F 38393 (0.5-10 mg/kg SC) did not elicit stereotypy. In contrast, yawning behavior was not produced after very high doses of talipexole (500 micrograms/kg SC) or SND 919 (1000 micrograms/kg SC) given alone or in combination with SK&F 38393 (0.5-10 mg/kg SC). These extremely high doses of talipexole or SND 919 evoked slight stereotypy, which was enhanced by the combined treatment with SK&F 38393. The present results suggest that the dopamine D-2 receptors related to yawning are more sensitive to dopamine receptor agonists than those related to stereotypy, and that concurrent stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine D-1 receptors with D-2 receptors reduces the incidence of yawning but enhances that of stereotypy.\n",
      "1. The effects of a chronic administration (around 30 mg/ kg/day) of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nimodipine, on apomorphine induced yawning behaviour of grouped or individual housed rats, were studied. 2. Nimodipine treatment had no effect in grouped rats. 3. Individually housed animals gave a significant lower number of yawns in respect to grouped controls: this difference disappeared in isolated, nimodipine treated, group. 4. The results show the ability of nimodipine to restore a depressed behavioural performance.\n",
      "In the present study, effects of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on physostigmine-induced yawning was investigated. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of different doses of physostigmine (0.03, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg) induced yawning in rats. The maximum response was obtained by 0.2 mg/kg of the drug. The alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, and the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, decreased yawning induced by physostigmine. Prazosin and higher doses of phenoxybenzamine reduced the inhibitory effect of phenylephrine. Higher doses of yohimbine also reduced the clonidine response. The adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin, phenoxybenzamine, and propranolol, did not significantly alter the physostigmine response. However, yohimbine, or lower doses of prazosin, decreased the physostigmine response. It may be concluded that alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation decreases the physostigmine-induced yawning behavior in rats.\n",
      "Possible involvement of catecholamine receptor activities in modulating the incidence of yawning, which involves activation of dopaminergic-cholinergic linked neuronal mechanism, was investigated in rats. Subcutaneous injection of talipexole (B-HT 920), a selective dopamine D2-receptor-agonist, elicited yawning behavior. This behavior was increased by prazosin and bunazosin, alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, and by pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The yawning induced by physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent, and pilocarpine, a direct muscarinic receptor agonist, was increased by pindolol, but was unaffected by prazosin and bunazosin. In addition, the yawning induced by the dopaminergic agonists, but not by the cholinergic agonists, was markedly suppressed by ST587, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist. All the yawning responses to dopaminergic and cholinergic agents were reduced not only by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, but also by idazoxan, rauwolscine, and yohimbine, alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. The results suggest that catecholamine receptor activities seem to play different roles in inhibitory modulation of the occurrence of yawning caused by dopaminergic and cholinergic stimulation.\n",
      "Single and repeated ECS decrease sensitivity of dopamine D2 and acetylcholine receptors as measured by yawning behavior.

      "Bromocriptine (BRC), a dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent and pilocarpine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist, produced yawning in rats, with the most effective doses being 2.5 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively. BRC-induced yawning was inhibited by high doses of SK&F38393 (5 and 10 mg/kg), a selective D-1 receptor agonist. BRC or SK&F38393 alone did not induced stereotyped behaviors. However, when BRC was administered after SK&F38393 (5.0 and 10 mg/kg), stereotyped behaviors occurred; i.e., mainly sniffing at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg BRC, and mainly licking and biting 10 and 20 mg/kg BRC. A high dose of apomorphine (4 mg/kg IP) completely inhibited physostigmine-induced yawning (physostigmine yawning) but did not affect pilocarpine-induced yawning (pilocarpine yawning). BRC (2.5 20 mg/kg) increased physostigmine yawning in an additive fashion. Pilocarpine yawning was completely blocked by either low or high doses of BRC. The inhibitory effect of BRC on pilocarpine yawning was reversed by sulpiride (20 mg/kg). alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT; 100 and 200 mg/kg) did not affect physostigmine yawning but diminished pilocarpine yawning. Furthermore, physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg) inhibited apomorphine (4.0 mg/kg)-induced hyperlocomotion and sniffing but not licking and biting, whereas pilocarpine (4.0 mg/kg) had the opposite effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Animals deprived of REM sleep by the water tank technique show an important decrease in frequency of yawning, induced by dopaminergic (apomorphine in low doses) and cholinergic (physostigmine and pilocarpine) agonists, if they are tested immediately after the 96 hr of deprivation. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of REM sleep deprivation on dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, we decided to test the animals after a recovery period of 24 hr. It was observed that apomorphine-induced yawning was still significantly reduced, whereas pilocarpine-induced yawning had returned to normal. The findings suggest that REM sleep deprivation alters dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in different ways: it seems that the interference on the dopaminergic system is prior and stronger than on the cholinergic system, thus its recovery demands more time.\n"

      "The effects of the putative, selective dopamine autoreceptor antagonist (+)-AJ 76 on yawning, penile grooming and mouth movements induced by small doses of apomorphine in male rats were examined. Yawning induced by 0.05mg/kg apomorphine was dose dependently blocked by (+)-AJ-76, significant decreases being observed at 0.86 and 3.5mg/kg of the drug. A dose of 0.86mg/kg (+)-AJ 76 caused a two fold shift to the right of the apomorphine dose response curve for yawning. In contrast, (+)-AJ 76 had no effect on penile grooming and vacuous mouth movements induced by small doses of apomorphine. This pattern of results is similar to that observed after bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the substantia nigra which also blocked apomorphine-induced yawning but spared penile grooming and mouth movements. Previous studies have suggested that (+)-AJ 76 is a selective dopamine autoreceptor antagonist that has little or no effect on behaviour mediated by post-synaptic dopamine receptors. Therefore, these data provide further support for the hypothesis that apomorphine-induced yawning is mediated by dopamine autoreceptors.\n",
      "When the azepine derivative BHT 920, a putative agonist at dopamine autoreceptors, was injected i.p. into adult male rats at 100 micrograms/kg, it induced numerous penile erections, stretching and yawning and sedation, all considered typical signs of central DA autoreceptor stimulation, but did not elicit stereotyped behaviour. Imidazole (37.5-150 mg/kg i.p.) and the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine (0.5-1 mg/kg i.p.) both antagonized the behavioural effects of BHT 920. In the light of the proposed selective action of the drugs used, the possible involvement of specific receptors for the modulation of these forms of behaviour, as well the possible relevance of the data presented, are briefly discussed.\n",
      "The study served to examine the effects of bifemelane on central dopaminergic-cholinergic neuronal mechanisms in rats. Bifemelane (5-20 mg/kg) evoked yawning responses, the frequency being low. Bifemelane (10 mg/kg) as well as bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg) potentiated physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg)-, bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg)- or apomorphine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg)-induced yawning but completely inhibited pilocarpine-induced yawning. Pretreatment with sulpiride (20 mg/kg) and a low dose of haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg) reversed the stimulatory effect of bifemelane on physostigmine-induced yawning and the inhibitory effect of the drug on pilocarpine-induced yawning, whereas atropine (5 mg/kg) diminished these yawning responses. SK&38393 (2.0 mg/kg), a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist, markedly potentiated bifemelane- and bromocriptine-induced yawning but inhibited physostigmine-induced yawning, and did not affect pilocarpine-induced yawning. The increased yawning responses were blocked by atropine and a low dose of haloperidol. Bifemelane (10 mg/kg) and bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg) tended to increase apomorphine (5 mg/kg)-induced oral stereotypy, such as licking and biting, but the increase was not significant. These results suggest that the effects of bifemelane on central dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons may be similar to those of bromocriptine.\n",
      "Apomorphine induced yawning in both Sprague-Dawley and F344 rats in the same dose range, but F344 rats emitted only about 1/4 as many yawns as did Sprague-Dawley rats. At higher doses, rats of both strains exhibited stereotypic behavior with a comparable intensity. Pretreatment with either SCH 23390 [R(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine-7-o l] or pindolol increased apomorphine-induced yawning further in Sprague-Dawley rats, but had little effect on the low yawning score produced by apomorphine in F344 rats. The low yawning response to apomorphine in F344 rats is, therefore, not due to a high baseline dopaminergic or adrenergic activity. Apomorphine-induced yawning in F344 rats was increased after an acute injection of physostigmine, or 24 h after an injection of reserpine. It is postulated that a low baseline cholinergic activity in F344 rats may be responsible, in part, for their lower yawning response to dopaminergic receptor stimulation.\n",
      "The IP injection of 2-(4-fluoro-3-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamines. (FDA 24), N-n-propyl-N-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine (FDA 27F) and N-n-propyl-N-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(4-fluoro-3-hydroxyphenyl) ethylamine (FDA 40) into adult male rats induced the stretching and yawning (SY) syndrome, FDA 24 being the least active. Moreover, FDA 27F and FDA 40 potentiated penile erection (PE) with respect to controls. For both signs (PE and SY), FDA 40 was the most potent of the three compounds. These effects, which are considered typical signs of central D-2-dopamine (DA) receptor stimulation, were dose-related and significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the selective D-2 DA antagonist, sulpiride, but not by domperidone, which does not cross the hematoencephalic barrier. In previous binding studies, FDA 27F and FDA 40 showed high affinity and selectivity for D-2 DA receptors, while FDA 24 had a low affinity for both D-1 and D-2 DA receptors. The present data show that FDA 27F and FDA 40 cross the blood-brain barrier and exert an agonistic effect on the central D-2 DA receptors. These results also provide evidence of the value of PE and SY tests as sensitive tools for the study of DA-neurochemical mechanisms.\n",
      "Apomorphine (Apo), a dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, induces yawning by stimulating central DA autoreceptors. Few data are available on Apo-induced yawning in man. A simple method for recording and measuring Apo-induced yawning by measuring the displacement of the lower jaw using a pair of linearlized magnetometers with one sensor attached to the forehead just below the hairline and the other under the chin is described. The output of the magnetometers is fed into a DC amplifier and displayed on a strip chart recorder. Complete concordance between evaluators reading the tracings and between observed yawning and recorded yawns was found. Measuring Apo-induced yawning may provide a simple approach to evaluating DA autoreceptor function in normal subjects and in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders. Preliminary data show that Apo-induced yawning is more marked in women than in men. This is in contrast to spontaneous and drug-induced yawning in animals which is predominantly a male phenomenon. Sleep appears to inhibit Apo-induced yawning.\n",
      "Yawning and stretching responses were elicited in rats by a small dose (0.3 mg/kg) of the highly selective dopamine D2 agonist, N-0437. The responses were blocked by the highly selective dopamine autoreceptor antagonist, (+)-UH 232 (3.0 mg/kg), but not by raclopride at a dose which selectively blocks postsynaptic D2 receptors. The results strongly confirm the view that yawning and stretching are behavioral responses elicited by stimulation of presynaptic D2 receptors.\n",

      "Adult male rats reared in social isolation for 28 +/- 2 days were compared with animals housed in groups and pairs for frequency of penile erection (PE) and stretching and yawning (SY) elicited by dopaminergic (DA) autoreceptorial doses of B-HT 920 and n-N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA). PE and SY were consistently lower in the isolated group with respect to the other two groups, which did not differ significantly. The present experiments show the importance of housing conditions in modulating behavioural responses to DA agonists, a result that was confirmed when adult male rats, isolated or paired immediately after weaning until the day of tests (56 +/- 2 days), were treated with B-HT 920. In this case, however, not only isolated but also paired rats differed from grouped rats of the same age in their response to B-HT 920.\n",
      "The effect of concurrent D-1 receptor stimulation by SKF 38393 on the expression of yawning elicited by D-2 receptor stimulation with LY 171555 was studied in the rat. A low dose of SKF 38393 (2.5 mg/kg SC), while failed to elicit yawning, potentiated the effectiveness of LY 171555 in eliciting yawning at all the doses tested (12.5, 25 and 50 micrograms/kg SC) and this effect was abolished by SCH 23390 (0.012 mg/kg SC). The results indicate that in analogy with typical post-synaptic dopaminergic effects (hypermotility-stereotypy), yawning elicited by a D-2 agonist is facilitated by concurrent stimulation of D-1 receptors and therefore is consistent with previous evidence that yawning in response to a D-2 agonist is not mediated by autoreceptors.\n"

      "The hypothesis that yawning and suppression of exploration, induced by low doses of dopamine agonists, are mediated by stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors was tested by studying the influence of amphetamine on these behavioural models and on extracellular levels of dopamine sampled by microdialysis. Behaviour was measured in a holeboard apparatus. A low dose of amphetamine (0.2 mg/kg) caused slight activation of habituated rats. The same dose of amphetamine completely counteracted the decrease in extracellular dopamine levels caused by pergolide (0.02 mg/kg) and, instead, elevated the dopamine levels to 300% above baseline. The same or higher doses of amphetamine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) did not completely antagonise suppression of exploration or yawning induced by apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg) or pergolide (0.02 mg/kg). The results suggest that both yawning and suppression of exploration induced by low doses of dopamine agonists are not mediated by dopamine autoreceptors, since these behaviours could be elicited when the extracellular levels of dopamine were elevated above baseline. The alternative hypothesis that these behaviours are mediated by sensitive post-synaptic receptors is suggested. It was also found that combined treatment with SCH 23390 (0.05 mg/kg) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg) induced yawning, which further supports the new hypothesis.\n",
      "The effects of naloxone on side effects provoked by apomorphine (APO) administration in patients with parkinsonian syndrome have been studied. The group under study included eight patients with Parkinson's disease and four with parkinsonism who received 100 micrograms/kg s.c. APO acutely to test dopaminergic responsiveness. All patients were treated with 20 mg domperidone tablets t.i.d. and then for 2 consecutive days (in double blind fashion) were given a 2-hour i.v. saline infusion alone or with naloxone (8 mg) starting 30 min before APO administration. In both groups, naloxone delayed the appearance of sleepiness, and reduced the intensity of yawning, sleepiness, nausea, and vomiting as compared with saline. These findings indicate a potential usefulness of naloxone and other opioid antagonists in preventing acute APO side effects.\n",

      "The effect of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus on drug-induced (apomorphine, oxytocin and NMDA) yawning and penile erection, and on the increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- occurring in the paraventricular dialysate in these experimental conditions, was studied in male rats. Muscimol (50, 100 and 200 ng) reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine (50 ng), oxytocin (30 ng) and NMDA (50 ng) delivered into the PVN. The reduction of penile erection and yawning was parallel to a reduction of the concomitant NO2- and NO3- increase that occurs in the paraventricular dialysate in this experimental condition. In contrast, baclofen (200 ng), a GABAB receptor agonist, was ineffective. The muscimol effects on drug-induced penile erection, yawning and NO2- increase were prevented by the prior administration of bicuculline (250 ng into the paraventricular nucleus). Muscimol (200 ng) but not baclofen (200 ng), injected into the PVN, reduced both noncontact erections in male rats placed in the presence of an inaccessible receptive female, and also the NO2- increase that occurs in the paraventricular dialysate in this experimental condition. As found with drug-induced penile erection, the muscimol reduction of noncontact erections and of NO2- increase was prevented by bicuculline. The present results show that the activation of GABAA receptors in the PVN reduces yawning and penile erection induced by drugs or physiological stimuli by reducing the increase in NO activity that occurs in this hypothalamic nucleus in these experimental conditions.\n",
      "The R-(+)-isomer of 7-hydroxy-2-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)tetralin (7-OH-DPAT) bound with a more than 200-fold higher affinity to cloned human dopamine D3 receptors (Ki = 0.57 nM) than to dopamine D2 receptors; the corresponding S-(-)-enantiomer had considerably less affinity for both dopamine receptor subtypes, indicating that the known enantiomer selectivity of 7-OH-DPAT for the 'classical' dopamine D2 receptor subtype extends to the recently discovered dopamine D3 receptor subtype. In rats R-(+)-7-OH-DPAT dose dependently (10-1000 nmol/kg) decreased dopamine release and induced yawning, while sniffing behaviour occurred at the highest dose tested (1000 nmol/kg). The possibility that the inhibition of dopamine release and the elicitation of yawning are mediated by dopamine D3 receptors is considered.\n",
      "In the present study, the effects of a single administration of buspirone (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg sc-30 min before testing) on three dopamine-related behaviors were evaluated in 4-month old male Wistar rats (7-10 animals per group). Buspirone decreased haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg ip)-induced catalepsy in a dose-dependent manner (from 7.30 to 5.09 1n of s compared to the untreated control group). Apomorphine (0.06 mg/kg sc)-induced yawning was also dose-dependently reduced (from 26.7 to 0.9 yawns in 30 min) and so was apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg sc)-induced stereotypy (from 32.9 to 5.9, sum of scores). The present results indicate that buspirone presents unique pharmacological effects related to dopaminergic transmission not only in biochemical but also in behavioral terms.\n",
      "Otitis media with effusion (OME), a form of inflammatory middle ear disease, is a common reason for young children to visit their family doctor and to have surgery. Tubal dysfunction plays a major role in the pathogenesis. In case of persistent OME, there seems to be a logical rationale for a favourable effect on the tubal dysfunction of a functional active motoric approach combined with behavioral changes (hygiene), and as a consequence for a therapeutic effect on the middle ear disease. The basic principles of this functional treatment are: active ventilation of the middle ear, correction of immature and undesirable deviant mouth habits, increasing swallowing frequency, activating jaw and palate movements, and encouraging the use of chewing gum. The bases for this functional therapy are critically analysed, and it may be concluded that all of these principles rely upon evidence based physiological mechanisms. However, the limited available clinical data from the literature are reviewed, and appear as methodologically weak. The results of an own prospective randomized pilot study comparing functional treatment with watchful waiting may be considered encouraging, since a borderline significance level was reached with a small amount of subjects.\n",
      "In the present work the effects of GABA agonists and antagonists on yawning induced by physostigmine have been studied. Intraperitoneally (IP) injection of physostigmine (0.05-0.3 mg/kg) induced dose-related yawning in rats. The maximum yawning response was observed with 0.2 mg/kg of the drug. The GABA agonists muscimol (1-4 mg/kg) and baclofen (0.125-1 mg/kg) decreased yawning induced by physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg) dose dependently. Combination of both GABA agonists elicited greater inhibition of yawning. The GABA-A antagonists bicuculline or picrotoxin but not the GABA-B antagonist phaclofen reduced the inhibitory response induced by muscimol, whereas phaclofen but not bicuculline or picrotoxin reduced baclofen's inhibitory effect. Administration of bicuculline, picrotoxin or phaclofen also decreased the yawning induced by physostigmine. However, when the GABA-A and GABA-B antagonists were employed in combination, the inhibitory responses of both drugs were lost. It is concluded that GABA-A and/or GABA-B receptor stimulation may inhibit physostigmine-induced yawning.\n",
      "Eating requires mouth opening, biting, chewing and swallowing and should be performed without dysfunction or pain. Previous studies have shown that jaw opening-closing movements are the result of coordinated activation of both jaw and neck muscles, with simultaneous movements in the temporomandibular, atlanto-occipital and cervical spine joints. Consequently, it can be assumed that pain or dysfunction in any of the three joint systems involved could impair jaw activities. In fact, recent findings support this hypothesis by showing an association between neck injury and reduced amplitudes, speed and coordination of integrated jaw-neck movements. This study investigated the possible association between neck injury and disturbed eating behaviour. Fifty Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) patients with pain and dysfunction in thejaw-face region and 50 healthy age- and sex-matched controls without any history of neck injury participated in the study. All participants were assessed by a questionnaire, which contained 26 items about eating behaviour, jaw pain and dysfunction. For the WAD group there were significant differences in jaw pain and dysfunction and eating behaviour before and after the accident, but no significant differences between WAD before and healthy. The healthy and the WAD group before the accident reported no or few symptoms. The WAD patients after the accident reported pain and dysfunction during mouth opening, biting, chewing, swallowing and yawning and felt fatigue, stiffness and numbness in the jaw-face region. In addition, a majority also reported avoiding tough food and big pieces of food, and taking breaks during meals. Altogether, these observations suggest an association between neck injury and disturbed jaw function and therefore impaired eating behaviour. A clinical implication is that examination of jaw function should be recommended as part of the assessment and rehabilitation of WAD patients.\n"

      "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of chronic treatment with apomorphine on yawning and stereotyped behaviors induced by apomorphine, and catalepic responses induced by haloperidol. Rats received apomorphine (1 mg/kg, sc), a direct dopamine D1/D2 agonist, or vehicle once a day for 21 days. The chronic treatment with apomorphine shifted to the right the dose response curve of yawning to administration of apomorphine, which preferentially activates presynaptic dopamine D-2 receptors (auto receptors) at low doses. Haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, ip)-induced catalepsy mediated by the inhibition of postsynaptic D-2 receptors was unaltered. A subsequent challenge dose of apomorphine (5 mg/kg, ip) produced oral stereotyped behaviors such as sniffing, licking and biting in the vehicle-treated rats. Chronic apomorphine treatment produced significant enhancement of sniffing alone, which may be behavioral sensitization to apomorphine, and, in contrast, attenuated licking and biting, which depend on D-2 receptor activities. These phenomena lasted for at least 30 days. Sniffing might involve relatively increased stimulation of D-1 receptors, as compared with licking and biting. These results suggest that chronic apomorphine reduces presynaptic dopamine D-2 receptor activity, and as a consequence may induce long-lasting postsynaptic dopamine receptor (mainly D-1 receptor) activation.\n",
      "Rationale: Identification of behaviors specifically mediated by the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors would allow for the determination of in vivo receptor selectivity and aide the development of novel therapeutics for dopamine-related diseases.\n",
      "Objectives: These studies were aimed at evaluating the specific receptors involved in the mediation of D2/D3 agonist-induced yawning and hypothermia.\n",
      "Materials and methods: The relative potencies of a series of D2-like agonists to produce yawning and hypothermia were determined. The ability of D3-selective and D2-selective antagonists to inhibit the induction of yawning and hypothermia were assessed and a series of D2/D3 antagonists were characterized with respect to their ability to alter yawning induced by a low and high dose of PD-128,907 and sumanirole-induced hypothermia.\n",
      "Results: D3-preferring agonists induced yawning at lower doses than those required to induce hypothermia and the D2-preferring agonist, sumanirole, induced hypothermia at lower doses than were necessary to induce yawning. The rank order of D3 selectivity was pramipexole > PD-128,907 = 7-OH-DPAT = quinpirole = quinelorane > apomorphine = U91,356A. Sumanirole had only D2 agonist effects. PG01,037, SB-277,011A, and U99,194 were all D3-selective antagonists, whereas haloperidol and L-741,626 were D2-selective antagonists and nafadotride's profile of action was more similar to the D2 antagonists than to the D3 antagonists.\n",
      "Conclusions: D3 and D2 receptors have specific roles in the mediation of yawning and hypothermia, respectively, and the analysis of these effects allow inferences to be made regarding the selectivity of D2/D3 agonists and antagonists with respect to their actions at D2 and D3 receptors.\n",

      "Microinjection of the dopamine (DA) agonist apomorphine into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) induced penile erection and yawning in rats. A significant effect was elicited by a dose of apomorphine as low as 5 ng. The symptomatology usually began within 5 min after the microinjection, lasted for 30-50 min, and was identical to that induced by the systemic administration of the drug. Stereotypy and hypermotility were never observed after apomorphine microinjection into the PVN, even at the highest dose tested (1 microgram). Microinjections of the same doses of apomorphine into the hypothalamic ventromedial and dorsomedial nucleus, preoptic area, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra, were ineffective. LY 171555, a specific D2 Da receptor agonist, and (+)-3-PPP, but not (-)-3-PPP nor the specific D1 DA receptor agonist SKF 38393, were as effective as apomorphine when injected into the PVN. Apomorphine-induced penile erection and yawning were antagonized by pretreatment with neuroleptic drugs, such as haloperidol, (-)-sulpiride, a specific D2 DA antagonist, and SCH 23390, a specific D1 DA antagonist. The present results suggest that the PVN is the brain area where D2 DA agonists act to induce penile erection and yawning. Moreover, since the PVN contains the cell bodies of a group of incerto-hypothalamic DA neurons, the above results suggest for the first time a possible involvement of the incerto-hypothalamic DA system in the expression of penile erection and yawning.\n",
      "When treated chronically with haloperidol, rats show progressively enhanced behavioral suppression, mimicking the delay of onset seen clinically with neuroleptics. To investigate potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying this delay, low-dose apomorphine treatment was administered after withdrawal from 21 days of 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol, to probe for depolarization inactivation or autoreceptor supersensitivity. This haloperidol treatment was subthreshold for inducing either dopamine autoreceptor supersensitivity or postsynaptic supersensitivity as evidenced by equivalent metabolic reductions in chronically treated neuroleptic versus vehicle groups, and an absence of stereotypical responding in either condition. However, haloperidol treated rats appeared subsensitive to yawning induced by 0.07 mg/kg apomorphine. This latter response appears to be generated from an as yet unidentified postsynaptic dopaminergic substrate. The present observation suggests that, within a therapeutically relevant dose range, repeated neuroleptic administration induces a complex set of neuroadaptive processes (both up- and down-regulation of pre- and postsynaptic sites) in the underlying substrate for these drugs' behavioral and biochemical effects.\n",
      "The behaviour of partially pre-satiated rats consuming a sweet palatable food and treated with either vehicle or the specific kappa receptor agonist U-50,488H (0.1-3 mg/kg) was recorded on videotape. Analysis revealed that the hyperphagia induced by the kappa agonist (0.3-3 mg/kg) resulted from an increase in the duration of feeding and not from an increase in the local rate of eating. The increase in duration was due, in turn, to a greater frequency of bouts of feeding. The kappa agonist also increased the latency to the final feeding bout. The effect of U-50,488H was consistent with de-satiation, so that the increase in feeding duration was in evidence from the start of the test period, while the temporal pattern of later satiation was preserved but lagged behind that of control animals. At the largest dose, other recorded activities (rearing, locomotor activity, grooming) were suppressed, with a marked increased in inactivity. At the lowest dose (0.1 mg/kg) there was a significant increase in grooming behaviour. The results are discussed with reference to an hypothesis of opioid function in the control of food intake.\n",
      "Low doses of BHT 920, LY 171555 and (+)3PPP, three dopamine agonists selective for D-2 receptors, induced yawning in rats. This effect was reduced by the selective D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 but the antagonism did not exceed a 50% reduction from the control values. In contrast, the selective D-2 antagonist (-)sulpiride completely abolished agonist-induced yawning. A 6 h reserpine pretreatment (5 mg/kg i.p.), which depletes brain dopamine (DA) by about 95%, reduced agonist-induced yawning by an extent similar to SCH 23390; in the reserpinized rats, SCH 23390 completely lost the property of blocking agonist-induced yawning while (-)sulpiride retained it. Two 5HT receptor antagonist, ketanserin and metergoline failed to influence agonist-induced yawning. The reportedly selective D-1 agonist, SKF 38393, failed to induce yawning in normal rats as well as in rats pretreated with reserpine 6 or 16 h earlier. If one excludes that SCH 23390 and the D-2 agonists interact with the same DA-receptors, the data are consistent with the possibility that stimulation of D-1 receptors by endogenous DA plays a permissive-facilitatory role for the behavioural expression of D-2 receptor activation.\n"

      "Endogenous opioid peptides have been implicated in the regulation of pain perception, behaviour, gastrointestinal activity and other physiological responses. However, the functional role of these peptides in the horse has yet to be elucidated. The opioid antagonist, naloxone, is often administered to infer endogenous opioid effects. In the present study, naloxone (0.75 mg/kg bodyweight) was administered to eight Thoroughbred racehorses and a number of behavioural and autonomic responses were measured. Naloxone produced rapid onset diarrhoea, restlessness, abdominal checking, tachycardia, tachypnoea, paradoxical yawning and diaphoresis. These responses described an acute abdominal distress syndrome similar to spasmodic colic. Results from this study suggest that, in the horse, endogenous opioids: 1) influence behaviour, 2) modify intestinal activity and sensation, and 3) if perturbed, may be involved in pathophysiology of colic.\n",
      "Subcutaneously (s.c.) administered apomorphine (0.0125-0.4 mg/kg) or physostigmine (0.025-0.4 mg/kg) to rats elicited yawning. The dose-response curves were bell-shaped. The peak effects of apomorphine and physostigmine were observed with a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of each drug. Yawning elicited by apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg) or physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) was reduced by intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, 50-200 mg/kg, given 30 min before). Yawning elicited by apomorphine but not by physostigmine was enhanced by p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA, 25-400 mg/kg i.p., given 24 h before). Apomorphine elicited but not physostigmine-elicited yawning was enhanced by pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 8 micrograms/rat, given 14 days before into the dorsal raphe). This treatment led to a 35% depletion of serotonin (5-HT) in the striatum. 5-HTP, p-CPA or 5,7-DHT given alone did not elicit yawning. Bilateral, intrastriatal microinjection of apomorphine (1.5-50 micrograms/site) but not physostigmine (5-50 micrograms/site) elicited yawning. The dose-response curve was also bell-shaped. These results indicate that central serotonergic pathways play an important role in modulating drug-elicited yawning in rats.\n",

      "Paradoxical sleep (PS) deprivation has been suggested to induce supersensitivity of postsynaptic dopamine (DA) receptors and subsensitivity of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Yawning behavior is reduced after PS deprivation and is believed to result from an interaction between ACh and DA systems. Concomitant treatment of PS deprived animals with DA agonists reverses PS deprivation effects on stereotypy and aggressiveness. To examine this possibility on yawning behavior, rats were treated, during the deprivation period, with atropine, methamphetamine, haloperidol or distilled water. Following PS deprivation, rats were injected with apomorphine or pilocarpine and number of yawns was recorded. Atropine increased yawning of PS deprived rats induced by pilocarpine, but not by apomorphine. Treatment with methamphetamine and haloperidol did not change PS deprivation effect on pilocarpine- and apomorphine-induced yawning. The data suggest that reversal of PS deprivation-induced yawning inhibition is mediated distinctly by both acetylcholine and dopamine systems.\n",
      "The present experiments were performed to investigate the potential role of central adrenergic neurons in regulating occurrence of yawning in rats. Intraperitoneal injection of tacrine (THA) or 9-amino-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta(b)-quinoline monohydrate HCl (NIK-247), cholinesterase inhibitors, induced yawning, which was markedly increased by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol. The yawning evoked by tacrine or NIK-247 given alone or in combination with pindolol was inhibited by pretreatment with scopolamine but not by mecamylamine or spiperone. Treatment with tacrine or NIK-247 increased acetylcholine content of the striatum, but this effect was not enhanced by pindolol, which per se did not affect basal acetylcholine content. Moreover, pretreatment with the central adrenaline synthesis inhibitors, (+-)-2,3-dichloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine HCl (LY-78335) and 2-cyclooctyl-2-hydroxyethylamine HCl (UK-1187A), increased tacrine-induced yawning. Subcutaneous injection of talipexole (B-HT 920), a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, evoked yawning, which was also increased by pindolol, LY-78335, and UK-1187A. These receptors antagonists and synthesis inhibitors per se did not cause yawning responses. The results suggest that the beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the inhibition of adrenaline synthesis facilitate the occurrence of yawning induced by cholinergic and dopaminergic agonists, and thus the central adrenergic neuronal systems may be implicated in the regulation of yawning responses.\n",
      "The present study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that yawning and suppression of exploration induced by low doses of dopamine agonists in the rat are caused by a reduction of synaptic dopamine levels. The decrease in extracellular levels of dopamine in the corpus striatum induced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha MPT, 50-200 mg/kg IP), reserpine (2-5 mg/kg SC) and apomorphine (APO, 0.05 mg/kg SC) was measured in microdialysis experiments. Reserpine and alpha MPT reduced the dopamine levels to the same extent as APO. Exploratory behaviour was suppressed by APO, but not by alpha MPT (50 and 100 mg/kg) when tested in a separate experiment. Reserpine (2 mg/kg) suppressed exploration after 4 hr, but not after 3 hr. Changes in extracellular levels of dopamine were tested simultaneously with changes in yawning in another group of rats implanted with guide cannulae for microdialysis probes. There was a discrepancy in the time-course for the induction of yawning as compared to the changes in extracellular dopamine levels after APO (0.05 mg/kg) as well as after pergolide (0.02 mg/kg SC). Yawning appeared before and lasted shorter than the decrease in dopamine. The time-courses for APO-induced suppression of exploration and yawning were similar. The dose-response curve for APO-induced yawning was not changed by alpha MPT (200 mg/kg), while the suppression of exploration induced by APO, but not by pergolide, was enhanced by pretreatment with alpha MPT. The results show that yawning and suppression of exploration induced by dopamine agonists are not related to changes in extracellular levels of dopamine. It is proposed that these behaviours may be mediated by postsynaptic receptors.\n",
      "Spontaneous behaviours were assessed in freely moving rats after treatment with equimolar doses of drugs that share a basic amphetamine structure. The drugs used included a psychomotor stimulant [(+)-amphetamine (AMPH)], an hallucinogen [para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA)] and the entactogens 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDE). A detailed analysis of the frequency and duration of 30 different behaviours and the temporal organization of the behaviours was conducted in addition to measuring motor activity with an automated device. Levels of the biogenic amines and their acid metabolites in discrete brain regions and brain drug levels were also obtained. The automated motor activity measures discriminated among entactogens, the stimulant and the hallucinogen, but failed to distinguish between the hallucinogen and vehicle. Principal components analysis and cluster analysis of the frequencies and durations of the behaviours did not improve the classification of the drugs over the automated motor activity measures. Only the cluster analysis of the transitions between individual behaviours succeeded in differentiating the drug classes from each other and from vehicle treatment. All the behavioural measures classified one entactogen (MDE) as an hallucinogen. Cortical 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) measures grouped MDE with the other entactogens but did not distinguish AMPH from vehicle. However, striatal dopamine measures differentiated AMPH from vehicle treatment. Variations in the durations of behavioural effects across drugs were associated with large differences in drug levels 3 h after injection. Although the neurochemical data provided a classification system that most closely parallels human subjective effects of these drugs, both the neurochemical and the behavioural measures supported the existence of an entactogen class distinct from a psychomotor stimulant and an hallucinogen.\n"

      "The present experiments were performed to examine the behavioral effects of OPC-14597, which acts on dopamine receptors in rats. OPC-14597 administered subcutaneously (SC) at doses of 0.1-5 mg/kg elicited yawning, as did OPC-4392 (0.5-2 mg/kg, SC) and (-)-3-PPP (2.5-10 mg/kg, SC). These yawning responses were blocked by intraperitoneal (IP) pretreatment with haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) but were increased by pindolol (20 mg/kg, IP) or reserpine (5 mg/kg, IP), which per se did not elicit yawning. The yawning induced by talipexole, a selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist, was inhibited by OPC-14597 (0.5-5 mg/kg, SC) and (-)-3-PPP (10 mg/kg, SC). Apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist, elicited stereotypy such as sniffing and licking but OPC-14597 (5-20 mg/kg, SC) did not induce this behavior. The stereotypy induced by apomorphine was inhibited not only by haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, IP) and (-)-3-PPP (10 mg/kg, SC) but also by OPC-14597 (5-20 mg/kg, SC), without being affected by OPC-4392 (2 mg/kg, SC). In 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats, apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg, SC) elicited rotation behavior whereas OPC-14597, OPC-4392 and (-)-3-PPP did not produce this behavior. These findings suggest that OPC-14597 provokes yawning without causing stereotypy and rotation but markedly antagonizes the talipexole-induced yawning and apomorphine-induced stereotypy, and that OPC-14597 thus exerts partial agonistic effects on yawning behavior but antagonistic effects on stereotypy in rats.\n",
      "Yawning was recorded from five rhesus monkeys restrained in a chair after i.m. injection of dopaminergic compounds: apomorphine (0.03 mg/kg), quinpirole (0.01 mg/kg), and (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine (1 mg/kg). SKF 38393 or physostigmine produced no yawning. Yawning from apomorphine was blocked by chlorpromazine or SCH 23390 (0.03 mg/kg). Sulpiride (10 mg/kg) was ineffective. The difference between rats and monkeys in their yawning response to dopaminergic compounds is discussed.\n",
      "Neonatal quinpirole treatment to rats produces long-term increases in D(2) receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the animal's lifetime, a phenomenon referred to as D(2) priming. Male and female Sprague-dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg kg(-1)) or saline from postnatal days (P)1-11. At P60, all animals were given an injection of quinpirole (100 microg kg(-1)), and results showed that rats neonatally treated with quinpirole demonstrated enhanced yawning in response to quinprole, verifying D(2) receptor priming because yawning is a D(2) receptor mediated event. Beginning 1-3 days later, locomotor sensitization was tested through administration of d-amphetamine (1 mg kg(-1)) or saline every other day over 14 days, and horizontal activity and turning behavior were analyzed. Findings indicated that D(2)-priming enhanced horizontal activity in response to amphetamine in females compared to males at Days 1 and 4 of locomotor sensitization testing, and D(2)-priming enhanced turning in response to amphetamine. Seven to ten days after sensitization was complete, microdialysis of the NAcc core was performed using a cumulative dosing regimen of amphetamine (0.1-3.0 mg kg(-1)). D(2)-primed rats administered amphetamine demonstrated a 500% increase in accumbal DA overflow compared to control rats administered amphetamine. Additionally, amphetamine produced a significant increase in NE overflow compared to controls, but this was unaffected by D(2) priming. These results indicate that D(2) receptor priming as is produced by neonatal quinpirole treatment robustly enhances behavioral activation and accumbal DA overflow in response to amphetamine, which may underlie increases in psychostimulant use and abuse within the psychotic population where increased D(2) receptor sensitivity is a hallmark.\n",
      "The aporphine alkaloids boldine and glaucine have been reported to show \"neuroleptic-like\" actions in mice, suggesting that they may act as dopamine antagonists. We have found that in vitro boldine displaces specific striatal [3H]-SCH 23390 binding with IC50 = 0.4 microM and [3H]-raclopride binding with IC50 = 0.5 microM, while the affinities of glaucine at the same sites are an order of magnitude lower. In vivo, however, 40 mg/kg boldine (i.p.) did not modify specific striatal [3H]-raclopride binding and only decreased [3H]-SCH 23390 binding by 25%. On the other hand, 40 mg/kg glaucine (i.p.) displaced both radioligands by about 50%. Behaviors (climbing, sniffing, grooming) elicited in mice by apomorphine (0.75 mg/kg s.c.) were not modified by boldine at doses up to 40 mg/kg (i.p.) but were almost completely abolished by 40 mg/kg glaucine (i.p.). In the apomorphine-induced (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) rat yawning and penile erection model, boldine and glaucine appeared to be similarly effective, inhibiting both behaviors by more than 50% at 40 mg/kg (i.p.). Boldine and glaucine, injected i.p. at doses up to 40 mg/kg, were poor modifiers of dopamine metabolism in mouse and rat striatum. These data suggest that boldine does not display effective central dopaminergic antagonist activities in vivo in spite of its good binding affinity at D1- and D2-like receptors, and that glaucine, although less effective in vitro, does appear to exhibit some antidopaminergic properties in vivo.\n",
      "The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of oral behaviors in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and a control group without TMD.In this baseline case-control study, 260 controls and 260 subjects with TMD completed the oral behaviors checklist defined as a \"self-report scale for identifying and quantifying the frequency of jaw overuse behavior\" and underwent clinical examinations using the DC/TMJ international examination form (version May 12, 2013). Relationships of oral parafunctions' frequencies between groups were examined. The statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software.Age and gender distribution in the study groups did not reveal statistical differences (P > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to establish system of independent oral behaviors for prognosis TMD. The stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that very frequent expression of holding, tightening, or tense muscles is associated with 10.83 times (P < 0.05) higher risk of TMD, grinding teeth together during waking hours with 4.94 times (P < 0.05) higher risk, and sustained talking with 2.64 times (P < 0.05) higher risk of TMD. By contrast, it was determined that 3 oral behaviors were less common in the TMD patients compared with the control group: clenching teeth together during waking hours, facing grimaces, and yawning (P < 0.05). The individuals with TMD reported a significantly higher frequency of 10 behaviors (P < 0.05), 3 of which may be regarded as independent risk factors for TMD. In addition, 3 oral behaviors were more frequently observed in the healthy subjects than in the TMD patients.\n",

      "The selective NK-3 tachykinin receptor agonist senktide elicited yawning, chewing mouth movements and sexual arousal following subcutaneous administration (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) in the rat. These responses were not significantly affected by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (0.03 mg/kg) or by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal projection. In contrast, the behaviours were markedly attenuated by the peripheral and central muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (1 mg/kg), but not by the peripheral muscarinic antagonist N-methylscopolamine (1 mg/kg). These findings suggest that stimulation of NK-3 receptors produces yawning, chewing and sexual arousal by directly activating central cholinergic neurons.\n",
      "Yawning was evoked by electrical or chemical stimulation in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. To evaluate physiological aspects of yawning, we monitored polygraphic measures as follows; a coordinated motor pattern of yawning was assessed by monitoring breathing [intercostal electromyogram (EMG)], mouth opening (digastric EMG), and stretching of the trunk (back EMG). We also recorded blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and the electrocorticogram (ECoG) to evaluate autonomic function and arousal responses during yawning. A stereotyped yawning response was reproducibly evoked by electrical stimulation or microinjection of -glutamate or NOC-7, a nitric oxide (NO)-releasing compound, into the PVN. The stereotyped yawning response consisted of two sequential events, an initial response represented a depressor response and an arousal shift in the ECoG to lower voltage and faster rhythms. These initial changes were followed by a yawning behavior characterized by a single large inspiration with mouth opening and stretching of the trunk. A similar sequence of events occurred during spontaneous yawning; a fall in BP and ECoG arousal preceded a yawning behavior. An increase in the frequency of spontaneous yawns was also observed after microinjection of -glutamate or NOC-7 into the PVN. Intravenous administration of NG-monomethyl--arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), prevented the stereotyped yawning response evoked by chemical stimulation of the PVN. Histological examination revealed that effective sites for the yawning responses were located in the medial part of the rostral PVN, the site of parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry showed the existence of NOS-containing cells in yawning-evoked sites of the PVN. In summary, the sequential events of yawning may be generated by NOS-containing parvocellular neurons in the medial part of the rostral PVN projecting to the lower brain stem.\n"

      "In the present study, effects of lead exposure on licking and yawning behaviour have been studied. The dopaminergic receptor agonist, apomorphine (0.15, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), induced dose-dependent licking in rats. The maximum response was obtained with 0.5 mg/kg of the apomorphine. Lead acetate (0.05%) exposure significantly increased apomorphine-induced licking. Yawning induced by the D2 dopaminergic agonist, bromocriptine (2, 3, 4, 8 mg/kg), and the cholinergic drug, physostigmine (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg), was significantly decreased by lead acetate (0.05%) exposure. It may be concluded that the behaviour induced by dopaminergic or cholinergic agents can be affected by lead subchronic exposure.\n",
      "1. Subcutaneous injection of isofloxythepin or haloperidol inhibited exploratory behaviour, methamphetamine (3 mg/kg)-induced hyperactivity and bromocriptine (15 mg/kg)-induced yawning, and also elicited catalepsy. 2. Isofloxythepin and haloperidol increased concentrations of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the striatum and elevated serum prolactin levels. 3. The results suggest that isofloxythepin, as well as haloperidol, blocks the action of the dopamine D2-receptors in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and pituitary.\n",
      "We describe the case of a 26-year-old man who presented with symptoms compatible with Lhermitte sign that occurred during yawning. It was associated with congenital partial aplasia of the posterior arch of the atlas. Cervical multisection-detector CT myelography during yawning showed compression of the upper cervical cord due to the inward mobility of the isolated posterior tubercle. The symptoms completely disappeared following removal of the isolated posterior tubercle.\n",
      "A specific role for the dopamine D3 receptor in behavior has yet to be elucidated. We now report that dopamine D2/D3 agonists elicit dose-dependent yawning behavior in rats, resulting in an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. A series of experiments was directed toward the hypothesis that the induction of yawning is a D3 receptor-mediated effect, whereas the inhibition of the yawning observed at higher doses is due to competing D2 receptor activity. We compared several dopaminergic agonists with a range of in vitro D3 selectivity, including PD-128,907 [(S)-(+)-(4aR, 10bR)-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano-[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol HCl], PD-128,908 [(R)-(-)-(4aS,10bS)-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano-[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol HCl], quinelorane [(5aR-trans)-5,5a,6,7,8, 9,9a,10-octahydro-6-propylpyrido[2,3-g]quinazolin-2-amine dihydrochloride], pramipexole (N'-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole-2,6-diamine), 7-OH-DPAT [(+/-)-7-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin HBr], quinpirole [trans-(-)-(4aR)-4,4a,5,6,7,8, 8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-g]quinoline HCl], bromocriptine [(+)-2-bromo-12'-hydroxy-2'-(1-methylethyl)-5'-(2-methylpropyl) ergotaman-3',6'-18-trione methanesulfonate], and apomorphine [(R)-(-)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-6-methyl-4H-dibenzo-[de,g]quinoline-10,11-diol HCl] with respect to their ability to induce yawning in rats. A series of D2/D3 antagonists differing in selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors were evaluated for their ability to alter the effects of the dopamine agonists. The antagonists L-741,626 (3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl]methyl-1H-indole), haloperidol (4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-piperidinyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-butanone HCl), nafadotride (N-[(1-butyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-4-cyano-1-methoxy-2-naphtha-lenecarboxamide), U99194 (2,3-dihydro-5,6-dimethoxy-N,N-dipropyl-1H-inden-2-amine maleate), SB-277011A (trans-N-[4-[2-(6-cyano-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]cyclohexyl]-4-quinolinecarboxamide), and PG01037 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide HCl) were used to determine effects on dose-response curves for D2/D3 agonist-induced yawning. In addition, the potential contribution of cholinergic and/or serotonergic mechanisms to the yawning response was investigated using a series of pharmacological tools including scopolamine [(a,S)-a-(hydroxymethyl)benzeneacetic acid (1a,2b,4b,5a,7b)-9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.02,4]-non7-yl ester hydrobromide], mianserin (1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-2-methyldibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2-a]azepine HCl), and the D3-preferring antagonists nafadotride, U99194, SB-277011A, and PG01037 to differentially modulate yawning induced by PD-128,907, physostigmine [(3aS)-cis-1,2,3,3a,8,8a-hexahydro-1,3a,8-trimethylpyrrolo[2,3-b]indol-5-ol methylcarbamate hemisulfate], and N-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperazine HCl. The results of these experiments provide convergent evidence that dopamine D2/D3 agonist-induced yawning is a D3 agonist-mediated behavior, with subsequent inhibition of yawning being driven by competing D2 agonist activity. Thus, dopamine agonist-induced yawning may represent an in vivo method for selectively identifying D3 and D2 receptor-mediated activities.\n",
      "The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) has been shown to mediate many of the behavioral effects of psychostimulants associated with high abuse potential. This study extended the assessment of the highly selective D3R antagonist PG01037 on cocaine and methamphetamine (MA) self-administration to include a food-drug choice procedure. Eight male rhesus monkeys (n=4/group) served as subjects in which complete cocaine and MA dose-response curves were determined daily in each session. When choice was stable, monkeys received acute and five-day treatment of PG01037 (1.0-5.6 mg/kg, i.v.). Acute administration of PG01037 was effective in reallocating choice from cocaine to food and decreasing cocaine intake, however, tolerance developed by day 5 of treatment. Up to doses that disrupted responding, MA choice and intake were not affected by PG01037 treatment. PG01037 decreased total reinforcers earned per session and the behavioral potency was significantly greater on MA-food choice compared to cocaine-food choice. Furthermore, the acute efficacy of PG01037 was correlated with the sensitivity of the D3/D2R agonist quinpirole to elicit yawning. These data suggest (1) that efficacy of D3R compounds in decreasing drug choice is greater in subjects with lower D3R, perhaps suggesting that it is percent occupancy that is the critical variable in determining efficacy and (2) differences in D3R activity in chronic cocaine vs. MA users. Although tolerance developed to the effects of PG01037 treatment on cocaine choice, tolerance did not develop to the disruptive effects on food-maintained responding. These findings suggest that combination treatments that decrease cocaine-induced elevations in DA may enhance the efficacy of D3R antagonists on cocaine self-administration.\n",
      "We report two cases of a singular side effect induced by clomipramine, one in a man, the other in a woman (both patients were beninese). This consisted of the occurring of the association of very frequent yawning and sexual excitation (sexual excitation with vaginal lubrification for the woman and hypogastric feeling of sexual pleasure for the man). It appeared after a few days of ambulatory treatment of a depression with clomipramine 75 mg/day. Clomipramine and demethylclomipramine blood levels were respectively 85 and 95 ng/ml and 70 and 80 ng/ml for the two patients. Three similar cases had been reported in the literature with this same tricyclic antidepressant. Recently a first case has been reported with fluoxetin. On this basis, it could be suggested that serotoninergic mechanisms are involved in the development of such clinical manifestations. But it seems reasonable to consider that serotoninergic mechanism could interact with a dopaminergic one. In favour of this hypothesis is the implication of dopaminergic mechanisms in yawning in man or in the association yawning--penile erections in the rat. Some others clinical arguments are discussed.\n",
      "Dose-dependent effects of 7-OH-DPAT on several behaviors, including place preference, were assessed. Three 2-day conditioning trials were conducted. On 1 day, animals received an injection of one of eight doses of 7-OH-DPAT (0-5 mg/kg) and were placed into a distinct compartment for 40 min. On the other day, animals received an injection of saline and were placed into a different compartment for 40 min. Locomotion, sniffing, and yawning were measured following the first and last injection of 7-OH-DPAT. Place conditioning was assessed on the day following the last trial. 7-OH-DPAT produced a U-shaped dose-dependent change in locomotion and sniffing, and an inverted U-shaped dose-dependent change in yawning. Additionally, repeated administration of 0.1 mg/kg sensitized yawning, whereas 5 mg/kg sensitized locomotion. None of the doses of 7-OH-DPAT produced conditioned place preference, however, there was a trend for conditioned place aversion at 0.03 mg/kg. By contrast, LiCl (127 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion and amphetamine (1 mg/kg) produced conditioned place preference using the same conditioning parameters. A subsequent experiment in which the number of animals and conditioning trials were increased demonstrated that the 0.03 mg/kg dose of 7-OH-DPAT produced conditioned place aversion. 7-OH-DPAT has a higher affinity for D3 receptors relative to D2 receptors. Therefore, it is suggested that intermediate doses (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) that increase yawning, and decrease locomotion and sniffing, may preferentially occupy D3 receptors. Furthermore, the results suggest that these putative D3-preferring doses have weak aversive effects.\n"

      "Background: In some cases of hemiplegia, the initiation of yawning is associated with involuntary raising of the paralysed arm. Reports are scarce in the literature, probably because the phenomenon has largely been overlooked.\n",
      "Methods: We studied six patients from two neurologic units, and compared them with published cases from the last 200 years. Brain imaging typically shows a small vascular lesion most often located in the internal capsule.\n",
      "Results: After comparison with experimental models in cats, we suggest that damage to the cortico-neocerebellar tract of the extrapyramidal system disinhibits the spino-archeocerebellar tract, enabling a motor stimulation of the arm by the lateral reticular nucleus, which harmonises both central respiratory and locomotor rhythms.\n",
      "Conclusions: When phylogenetically primitive structures are disinhibited, they regain autonomy in the homeostatic process associating the massive inspiration of yawning--a form of behaviour that stimulates vigilance--with a motor control mechanism that is active during locomotion. For this phenomenon, we coined the term 'parakinesia brachialis oscitans'.\n",
      "Spontaneous and pharmacologically provoked migraine attacks are frequently preceded by nonheadache symptoms called premonitory symptoms. Here, we systematically evaluated premonitory symptoms in migraine patients and healthy controls after glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion. In women with migraine without aura (n = 34) and age-matched female controls (n = 24), we conducted systematically a semistructured interview assessing 21 possible premonitory symptoms every 15 minutes in the 5 hours after GTN infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min over 20 minutes). Migraine-like headaches occurred in 28/34 (82.4%) migraineurs (GTN responders). After GTN, 26/28 (92.9%) responders, 6/6 (100%) nonresponders, and 13/24 (54.2%) controls reported at least one possible premonitory symptom. Concentration difficulties (P = 0.011), yawning (P = 0.009), nausea (P = 0.028), and photophobia (P = 0.001) were more frequently reported by those migraineurs who developed a migraine-like attack vs healthy controls. Importantly, concentration difficulties were exclusively reported by those who developed a migraine-like attack. Thus, our findings support the view that GTN is able to provoke the naturally occurring premonitory symptoms and show that yawning, nausea, photophobia, and concentration difficulties are most specific for an impending GTN-induced migraine-like headache. We suggest that these symptoms may also be helpful as early warning signals in clinical practice with concentration difficulties exclusively reported by those who develop a migraine-like attack.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain on daily living in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involving the TMJ. Nineteen patients (17 F, 2 M) with a median (IQR) age of 44 (23) years were included. A scale for the influence of TMJ pain/discomfort on the activities of daily living was used. TMJ resting pain and pain upon maximum mouth opening according to a visual analog scale as well as pressure pain threshold and tenderness to digital palpation of the TMJ were assessed. Blood samples were collected to measure the level of acute phase proteins. Activities of daily living were influenced in all patients at different levels. The impact on daily living by TMJ pain/discomfort was greatest on the performance of physical exercises and jaw movements, while it was smallest on the performance of hobbies and eating. Pain during maximum mouth opening and tenderness to digital palpation were correlated to difficulties with several activities such as to yawn and open the mouth wide, while pressure pain threshold was correlated with difficulties during eating, which confirms that the pain was located in the TMJ. In conclusion, this study indicates that pain/discomfort from the TMJ in patients with RA has a significant negative impact on activities of daily living.\n",
      "Repeated episodes of penile erection and yawning can be induced in male rats either by low doses of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine or by oxytocin given systematically or into a lateral ventricle (ICV), respectively, or after microinjection of the two substances directly in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These behavioral responses are prevented in a dose-dependent manner by the ICV administration of the potent oxytocin antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin. In contrast, the PVN injection of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin (1-30 ng), while effective in preventing oxytocin effect, was unable to prevent apomorphine response. On the other hand, apomorphine-, but not oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning was prevented by electrolytic lesion of the medial septum (MS). Such a lesion decreased oxytocin content by about 45% in the hippocampus. The above results suggest that the hypothalamic-hippocampal oxytocinergic pathway mediates apomorphine-induced penile erection and yawning and that oxytocin is involved at different levels in the CNS for the control of these behavioral responses.\n",
      "Objectives: To determine the impact of mandibular two-implant overdentures or conventional complete dentures on leisure and sexual activities.\n",
      "Methods: One hundred and two subjects, aged 35-65 years, received either mandibular overdentures retained by two implants (IOD; n=54) or new mandibular conventional complete dentures (CD; n=48) in a randomized controlled clinical trial. A Social Impact Questionnaire was used to assess the impact on social and sexual activity including avoiding conversation, refusing invitations, avoiding sport and feeling uneasy when kissing and in sexual relationships, and the looseness of the prostheses during such activities. Ratings were recorded on categorical scales at baseline and 2 months after treatment. Oral health related quality of life was measured with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP). Between and within group comparisons were carried out using regression models. The correlation between post-treatment OHIP scores and the leisure and sexual impact items was assessed.\n",
      "Results: Two months after delivery of the prosthesis there was significant improvements in the IOD group for looseness when eating, speaking, kissing and yawning. The IOD group reported significantly less post treatment looseness than the CD group for all parameters investigated (p<0.0001). IOD subjects felt less uneasy kissing and less uneasy during sexual activity than CD subjects. Correlations between the two sexual activity items (uneasiness when kissing and during sexual relations) and the OHIP scales were weak.\n",

      "Rationale and objectives: Because of known and imputed roles of dopaminergic and nicotinic cholinergic systems in a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, combined neurochemical and behavioral methods assessments were made to study the intermodulatory roles of these neurochemical systems.\n",
      "Methods: Rats were treated daily during postnatal ontogeny with the dopamine D2/D) agonist, quinpirole (QNP) HCl (1.0 mg/kg/day), for the first 3 weeks from birth. This priming process replicated previous findings of behavioral sensitization, manifested as hyperlocomotion, increased paw treading with jumping, and increased yawning.\n",
      "Results: All effects were partially or totally blocked by acute treatment with nicotine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.). The effects of nicotine, in turn, were partially or totally blocked by the nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.). In concert with these behavioral actions, QNP-primed rats displayed greater binding of [3H]cytisine in midbrain and cerebellum and greater [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding in hippocampus and striatum.\n",
      "Conclusions: Accordingly, these selective ligands for alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nicotinic receptors, respectively, demonstrate that nicotinic receptors are altered by dopamine D2/D3 agonist treatment of rats with primed dopamine receptors. We propose that nicotinic agonists may have a therapeutic benefit in behavioral disorders brought about by central dopaminergic imbalance.\n"

      "The effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of pertussis toxin on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine and oxytocin was studied in male rats. Pertussis toxin (2 micrograms ICV) prevented the above behavioral responses to apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg SC) and oxytocin (30 ng ICV) on day 3 and 4, but not on day 0 and 1 after treatment. Oxytocin and apomorphine responses were restored on day 6. Similar results were obtained by microinjecting pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the most sensitive brain area for the induction of penile erection and yawning by oxytocin and apomorphine. The results suggest that G proteins are involved in the expression of above responses to apomorphine and oxytocin.\n",
      "The discriminative stimulus effects of dopamine (DA) D3/D2 receptor agonists are thought to be mediated by D2 receptors. To maintain responding, access to food is often restricted, which can alter neurochemical and behavioral effects of drugs acting on DA systems. This study established stimulus control with quinpirole in free-feeding rats and tested the ability of agonists to mimic and antagonists to attenuate the effects of quinpirole. The same antagonists were studied for their ability to attenuate quinpirole-induced yawning and hypothermia. DA receptor agonists apomorphine and lisuride, but not amphetamine and morphine, occasioned responding on the quinpirole lever. The discriminative stimulus effects of quinpirole were attenuated by the D3 receptor-selective antagonist N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide HCl (PG01037) and the nonselective D3/D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, but not by the D2 receptor-selective antagonist 3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl]methyl-1H-indole (L-741,626); the potencies of PG01037 and raclopride to antagonize this effect of quinpirole paralleled their potencies to antagonize the ascending limb of the quinpirole yawning dose-response curve (thought to be mediated by D3 receptors). L-741,626 selectively antagonized the descending limb of the quinpirole yawning dose-response curve, and both L-741,626 and raclopride, but not PG01037, antagonized the hypothermic effects of quinpirole (thought to be mediated by D2 receptors). Food restriction (10 g/day/7 days) significantly decreased quinpirole-induced yawning without affecting the quinpirole discrimination. Many discrimination studies on DA receptor agonists use food-restricted rats; together with those studies, the current experiment using free-feeding rats suggests that feeding conditions affecting the behavioral effects of direct-acting DA receptor agonists might also have an impact on the effects of indirect-acting agonists such as cocaine and amphetamine.\n",
      "Male, Wistar rats were given a course of eight electroconvulsive shock seizures (ECS group) or matched handling (control group). They were then tested for locomotion and rearing (7 days post-ECS), for grooming and yawning (9 days post-ECS), and for immobility in the Porsolt test (7, 14 and 21 days post-ECS). Seven days post-seizure, the ECS group showed significantly more locomotion following intraperitoneal administration of apomorphine (0.2 mg/kg), but not following injections of amphetamine (1 mg/kg). Drug-induced rearing was not different in the ECS and control animals. Nine days post-seizure, the ECS group showed significantly more grooming induced by the D-1 dopamine receptor agonist, SKF 38393 (1 mg/kg), but no difference in the yawning induced by the D-2 dopamine receptor agonist, quinpirole (0.05 mg/kg). In the Porsolt test, immobility was decreased in the ECS animals at 7 and 14, but not at 21 days post-ECS. It is concluded that ECS increases activity in the dopaminergic systems of the rat brain for at least 1-2 weeks post-seizure. The beneficial effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may relate to these dopaminergic alterations.\n",
      "Background: Patients complaining about chronic dyspnea, in whom the dyspnea remains unexplained following a thorough diagnostic evaluation, will be defined as having unexplained psychogenic or anxiety dyspnea.\n",
      "Aim: To evaluate the clinical picture of patients with anxiety dyspnea, to evaluate their state of anxiety and whether their dyspnea is related to higher than normal perception of dyspnea.\n",
      "Patients and methods: Forty-six patients with continuous complaints of dyspnea, with no obvious cause of dyspnea, were recruited for the study. The perception of dyspnea (POD) and their anxiety state (using the HADS questionnaire) were evaluated.\n",
      "Results: Dyspnea that is not related to effort (100% of the patients), difficulties in filling the lung (93%), the need for occasional sigh breathing (93%), and the need for occasional yawns in order to fill the lung (83%) were the most characteristic symptoms. Thirty-two patients (70%) were positive for anxiety states and surprisingly had lower than normal POD.\n",
      "Conclusions: Our study suggests that patients with anxiety dyspnea have characteristic clinical presentation: dyspnea that is not related to effort, difficulties in filling the lung, and need for occasional sighs and/or yawns in order to be able to fill the lung. If baseline evaluation is negative for an organic cause of dyspnea, the diagnosis of anxiety dyspnea can be established with no further costly diagnostic procedures.\n",
      "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), a chronic, familial, neuropsychiatric disorder of unknown etiology, is characterized clinically by the presence of motor and vocal tics that wax and wane in severity over time and by the occurrence of a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances including hyperactivity, self-mutilatory behavior, obsessive compulsive behavior, learning disabilities, and conduct disorder. Pharmacological studies suggest that the tics of GTS result from dysfunction of monoaminergic systems, more specifically from increased dopaminergic activity due to postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity. However, given that striatal dopaminergic and cholinergic systems exhibit reciprocal antagonism in other movement disorders such as Parkinsonism and chorea, it is conceivable that the cholinergic system is implicated in the disease. In the present communication it is proposed that: (a) the emergence of motor and vocal tics in GTS is associated with increased central cholinergic activity; (b) cholinergic overactivity is involved in the manifestation of other symptoms in GTS including depression, sleep disorders, motion sickness, pain, sensory tics, and the waxing and waning course of the disease; (c) abnormalities of the cholinergic system support previous evidence linking GTS with delayed cerebral maturation in a subset of young patients; and (d) drugs which stimulate cholinergic receptors may exacerbate symptoms of GTS, and as with dopamine agonists, should be avoided in patients with GTS.\n",
      "Orexin-A is a neuropeptide which has been suggested to be involved in sleep and arousal mechanisms. Orexin-A, for example, stimulates arousal when administrated intracerebroventricularly to rats. We attempted to identify specific neural sites of orexin-A and orexin-B action. Orexin-A and orexin-B were microinjected into the medial parvocellular subdivision of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats, and cortical arousal and yawning responses were assessed. Cortical arousal responses were monitored with the electrocorticogram (ECoG), and yawning responses were evaluated by monitoring intercostal electromyograms as an index of inspiratory activity and digastric electromyograms as an indicator of mouth opening. We also measured blood pressure and heart rate during yawning responses, since yawning is accompanied by changes in autonomic activity. Microinjection of orexin-A into the PVN elicited an arousal shift in the ECoG to lower voltage and faster rhythms. This cortical arousal response was followed by a single large inspiration with mouth opening, i.e. a yawning response. On the other hand, microinjection of orexin-B into the PVN elicited an arousal shift in the ECoG without yawning responses. These results demonstrate that an orexin receptive site for triggering arousal/yawning responses exists in the PVN, and suggest that the PVN is involved in arousal mechanisms.\n"

      "Material and methods: Six normal adult volunteers were studied. Contrast dye was kept at the orifices of the Eustachian tube during swallowing and/or yawning by placing volunteers in either a head-down or lateral decubitus position. Reflux was determined by the presence of contrast dye in the middle ear on CT scanning of the temporal bone.\n",

      "Background: The larynx bypass (LB) is the only device capable of providing laryngectomy patients with the ability to smell. Our findings regarding one-time and long-term use did reveal an improved olfactory function in these patients. Because the LB is difficult to use, however, it is not appropriate for everyday use. Therefore, we devised a new instrument: the scent-diffusing ventilator (SV).\n",
      "Methods: Between January 2006 and February 2007, we researched the olfactory function of 16 patients who had undergone a laryngectomy (13 men/3 women; median age, 63 years) by using the LB and the SV. Their olfactory function was measured with the Sniffin' Sticks test battery. Further practicability of both methods was determined through a visual analog scale (1-10).\n",
      "Results: The patients' olfactory function significantly improved (SV median 8 versus LB median 7; p < 0.002). In addition, the SV was much easier to use than the LB (median, 6 versus 5; p < 0.001).\n",

      "Long-term electromyography with portable recorders allows the study of muscle activity in the natural environment to investigate whether muscle overuse or oral habits may contribute to initiate or perpetuate a myoarthropathy of the masticatory system. At present, little is known about the behaviour of masticatory muscles over long time periods. The aim of this preliminary study was to define parameters which allow the automatic recognition of different types of oral activities from the electromyogram form. A programme with functional and parafunctional activities was performed by four volunteers (total of 333 functional and 82 parafunctional recordings). Electromyograms of the masseter and temporal muscles were recorded by means of a self-developed portable intelligent solid state recorder. Signal mean level (mw) and dynamics (dw) within a sliding window were determined. Temporal muscle recordings allowed better discrimination between function and simulated parafunction. The average of mw for clenching was 51.4 +/- 3.5% and for tooth grinding 21.2 +/- 2% of the peak electromyogram value at maximum voluntary clench. At 0.96 s sliding window duration, clenching, tooth grinding and chewing signals had maximum separation, using dw/mw as parameters (average: 0.16 +/- 0.01 for clenching, 0.39 +/- 0.01 for teeth grinding and 0.88 +/- 0.01 for chewing).\n",
      "Three behavioral models were used to characterize the pharmacological action of BCH 325 on central dopaminergic transmission. The effect of acute SC treatment with BCH 325 upon dopaminergic mechanisms affecting motor activity was studied on the climbing behavior of mice. It was shown that the beta-casomorphin analogue evoked a dose-dependent increase in apomorphine (APO)-induced hypoactivity that was reversed by sulpiride (SULP). In in vitro studies on slices of nucleus accumbens of mice it could be demonstrated that 10(-6) M APO caused a reduction of K(+)-stimulated [14C]dopamine (DA) release that was potentiated following simultaneous incubation with 10(-6) M BCH 325. To prove a postsynaptic influence in D1 receptor-mediated behavior pattern, the action of BCH 325 was studied on bromocriptine (BROMO)-evoked yawning behavior of rats after pretreatment with reserpine (RES) or saline. The peptide could not influence the BROMO yawning after saline administration, but it was able to normalize the number of yawns, which were reduced after RES. To investigate the effect of BCH 325 on postsynaptic D2 receptors, jerking behavior on RES-pretreated rats after a high dose of BROMO was used. Following RES pretreatment only, the number of BROMO-induced jerks was decreased by treatment of rats with 0.5 mumol/kg BCH 325. In contrast, the jerking behavior was enhanced by 0.5 mumol/kg BCH 325 in rats that were additionally treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (MPT). In biochemical studies on slices of the nucleus accumbens of mice, the in vivo pretreatment with RES caused a reduction of K(+)-stimulated [14C]DA release that was blocked by the SC administration of 0.5 mumol/kg BCH 325.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "The yawns and penile erection elicited in rats by apomorphine (100 micrograms/kg SC) are dose-dependently suppressed by the enkephalinase-resistant analog of NT, [D-Trp11]NT, intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injected (10-120 ng per rat). This antagonistic effect was shared by NT (0.75-3 micrograms per rat) administered ICV. The yawns induced by pilocarpine (2 mg/kg IP) were similarly antagonized by [D-Trp11]NT (30-120 ng per rat). The enkephalinase inhibitor acetorphan (5 mg/kg IV) reduced in a naloxone (2 mg/kg, SC)-resistant manner the apomorphine-induced penile erection or yawning.\n",
      "The present report describes for the first time the effects of systemic administration of apomorphine and of physostigmine, as well as the effects of central and systemic administration of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), on penile erection and yawning in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Systemic administration of apomorphine induced both penile erection and yawning in non-diabetic rats but not in diabetic rats, while that of physostigmine induced only yawning in non-diabetic rats, and neither yawning nor penile erection in diabetic rats. Intracerebroventricular administration of VIP induced both penile erection and yawning in non-diabetic rats, but neither was induced in diabetic rats. Application of VIP as an ointment to the surface of the glans penis induced penile erection but not yawning in both non-diabetic and diabetic rats. Thus, penile erection and yawning are less easily induced in diabetic rats than in non-diabetic rats. Grooming occurred whenever penile erection was induced, but was not associated with yawning.\n",
      "Antineoplastons are naturally occurring cytodifferentiating agents. Chemically, antineoplastons are medium and small sized peptides, amino acid derivatives and organic acids which exist in blood, tissues and urine. In clinical trials in advanced cancer, in addition to the anticancer activity it was observed that patients suffering from both cancer and Parkinson's disease exhibited marked improvement in parkinsonian symtomatology when treated with antineoplaston A5. The present study was designed to analyse the influence of A5 on central dopaminergic structures. Mice and rats were given A5 intraperitoneally at three different dosage levels. Experiments conducted included spontaneous locomotor activity, amphetamine-induced yawning and erections, catalepsy, the effect on the level and utilization of noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain and the influence of prolonged and chronic treatment on the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It has been demonstrated that A5 stimulates the central dopaminergic receptors. It diminishes the cataleptic response to haloperidol and enhances the incidence of apomorphine-induced yawning. Biochemical studies demonstrated increased concentration of dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain and diminished utilization of both catecholamines.\n",
      "Chelidonine administered to rats in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg ip exerted an inhibitory effect on the dopaminergic structures in the rat. It was shown that chelidonine decreased amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity and inhibited amphetamine and apomorphine sterotype. Besides, chelidonine significantly inhibited the yawning and penile erection produced by apomorphine. However, chelidonine potentiated also catalepsy caused by haloperidol. In doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg ip chelidonine depressed the whole brain dopamine (DA) concentrations and enhanced DA utilization.\n"

      "Combined optogenetic activation of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN; a CO2/proton-activated brainstem nucleus) with nearby catecholaminergic neurons (C1 and A5), or selective C1 neuron stimulation, increases blood pressure (BP) and breathing, causes arousal from non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, and triggers sighs. Here we wished to determine which of these physiological responses are elicited when RTN neurons are selectively activated. The left rostral RTN and nearby A5 neurons were transduced with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2(+)) using a lentiviral vector. Very few C1 cells were transduced. BP, breathing, EEG, and neck EMG were monitored. During non-REM sleep, photostimulation of ChR2(+) neurons (20s, 2-20 Hz) instantly increased V̇e without changing BP (13 rats). V̇e and BP were unaffected by light in nine control (ChR2(-)) rats. Photostimulation produced no sighs and caused arousal (EEG desynchronization) more frequently in ChR2(+) than ChR2(-) rats (62 ± 5% of trials vs. 25 ± 2%; P < 0.0001). Six ChR2(+) rats then received spinal injections of a saporin-based toxin that spared RTN neurons but destroyed surrounding catecholaminergic neurons. Photostimulation of the ChR2(+) neurons produced the same ventilatory stimulation before and after lesion, but arousal was no longer elicited. Overall (all ChR2(+) rats combined), ΔV̇e correlated with the number of ChR2(+) RTN neurons whereas arousal probability correlated with the number of ChR2(+) catecholaminergic neurons. In conclusion, RTN neurons activate breathing powerfully and, unlike the C1 cells, have minimal effects on BP and have a weak arousal capability at best. A5 neuron stimulation produces little effect on breathing and BP but does appear to facilitate arousal.\n",

      "Our previous studies have suggested that activation of the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) descending oxytocinergic projections is involved in the induction of yawning accompanied by an arousal response, but the possibility that neural systems other than the oxytocinergic system in the PVN also mediate the arousal/yawning response cannot be ruled out. We assessed the activity of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons during yawning induced by the PVN stimulation in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats using double-staining for c-Fos and CRF. Yawning response was evaluated by monitoring an intercostals electromyogram as an index of inspiratory activity and a digastric electromyogram as an indicator of mouth opening. We also recorded the electrocorticogram (ECoG) to determine the arousal response during yawning. Microinjection of l-glutamate (2-5 nmol) into the PVN produced a frequent yawning accompanied by an arousal shift in the ECoG, and these behavioral effects were associated with a significant increase of c-Fos positive CRF neurons in the medial parvocellular subdivision of the PVN. In addition, a marked enhancement in the c-Fos expression was found in the both locus coeruleus (LC) and global area in the cortex when the frequency of yawning response was increased by the PVN stimulation, suggesting that the arousal response during yawning might be mediated by the activation of LC neurons. The present study suggests that an activation of CRF neurons in the PVN is responsible for the arousal response accompanied by yawning behavior.\n",
      "Previous reports have shown that the inbred High-Yawning (HY) and Low-Yawning (LY) rats differ in several behavioral characteristics related to mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) function. To determine if differential expression of DA receptors or DA transporter may mediate the behavioral differences in these two sublines of the Sprague-Dawley rat, we performed a quantitative autoradiography study of the DA D1-like, D2-like, and DA-transporter binding in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens. The results show that levels of the D1 binding in the caudate-putamen of the HY rat were higher than in the LY animals, whereas no significant differences in the DA D2 receptors and DA transporter were noted in these sublines. These data suggest that the differences in DA receptors in D1 binding in HY rats may in part have contributed to the behavioral differences related to DA functions such as grooming and penile erection. Our findings are consistent with previous reports showing a decrease in the behavioral responses after systemic administration of DA agonist in LY compared to HY rats.\n",

Both brain hemispheres showed periodic squeezing of the ventricles, with peak velocities up to 1 mm/sec followed by a slower recoil.

During the Valsalva maneuver, the brain stem showed initial caudal and subsequent cranial displacement of 2-3 mm. Coughing produced a short swing of CSF in the cephalic direction.\n",

      "Restricting animals to different areas of their enclosure, for both brief and extended durations, is a key element of animal management practices. With such restrictions, available space decreases and the choices the animals can make are more limited, particularly in relation to social dynamics. When unfamiliar individuals are introduced to each other, group dynamics can be unpredictable and understanding space usage is important to facilitate successful introductions. We studied the behavioral, welfare-related responses of two groups of zoo-housed chimpanzees (n = 22) as they were introduced to each other and experienced a variety of enclosure restrictions and group composition changes. Our analysis of available space while controlling for chimpanzee density, found that arousal-related scratching and yawning decreased as the number of enclosure areas (separate rooms) available increased, whereas only yawning decreased as the amount of available space (m(2)) increased. Allogrooming, rubbing, and regurgitation/reingestion rates remained constant as both the number of enclosure areas and amount of space changed. Enclosure space is important to zoo-housed chimpanzees, but during introductions, a decrease in arousal-related scratching indicates that the number of accessible areas is more important than the total amount of space available, suggesting that it is important to provide modular enclosures that provide choice and flexible usage, to minimize the welfare impact of short- and long-term husbandry needs.\n",
      "Antagonists of serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptors have been reported to enhance cognition in animal models of learning, although this finding has not been universal. We have assessed the therapeutic potential of the specific 5-HT6 receptor antagonists 4-amino-N-(2,6-bis-methylamino-pyrimidin-4-yl)-benzenesulfonamide (Ro 04-6790) and 5-chloro-N-(4-methoxy-3-piperazin-1-yl-phenyl)-3-methyl-2-benzothiophenesulfonamide (SB-271046) in rodent models of cognitive function. Although mice express the 5-HT6 receptor and the function of this receptor has been investigated in mice, all reports of activity with 5-HT6 receptor antagonists have used rat models. In the present study, receptor binding revealed that the pharmacological properties of the mouse receptor are different from the rat and human receptor: Ro 04-6790 does not bind to the mouse 5-HT6 receptor, so all in vivo testing included in the present report was conducted in rats. We replicated previous reports that 5-HT6 receptor antagonists produce a stretching syndrome previously shown to be mediated through cholinergic mechanisms, but Ro 04-6790 and SB-271046 failed to attenuate scopolamine-induced deficits in a test of contextual fear conditioning. We also failed to replicate the significant effects reported previously in both an autoshaping task and in a version of the Morris water maze. The results of our experiments are not consistent with previous reports that suggested that 5-HT6 antagonists might have therapeutic potential for cognitive disorders.\n"

      "Previous finding of concomitant mandibular and head movements during jaw function suggest a functional relation between the human jaw and neck regions. This study examined the temporal coordination between mandibular and head-neck movements during maximal jaw opening-closing tasks, at fast and slow speed. Twenty-four healthy individuals, median age 25 years, participated in the study. They were seated with firm back support but without head-neck support. Mandibular and head movements were simultaneously monitored by a wireless optoelectronic system for three-dimensional movement recording. The timing of head movement in relation to mandibular movement was estimated at defined time-points (start, peak, end and maximum velocity of movement), and during the entire course of the jaw-opening and jaw-closing phases. The results showed that the head in general started to move simultaneously with or before the mandible, reached the peak position simultaneously with, before or after the mandible, and reached the end position after the mandible. A higher degree of temporal coordination was found for fast speed at the start and the peak positions. The head most often attained maximum velocity after the mandible, and mostly lagged behind the mandible during the entire jaw-opening and -closing phases. These findings support the notion of a functional linkage between the human temporomandibular and craniocervical regions. They suggest that \"functional jaw movements\" comprise concomitant mandibular and head-neck movements which involve the temporomandibular, the atlanto-occipital and the cervical spine joints, and are caused by jointly activated jaw and neck muscles. It is proposed that these jaw and neck muscle actions, particularly at fast speed, are elicited and synchronized by preprogrammed neural command(s) common to both the jaw and the neck motor systems. From the present results and previous observations of concurrent jaw and head movement during fetal yawning, we suggest that these motor programmes are innate.\n",
      "Introduction: In some cases of hemiplegia the onset of yawning is associated with an involuntary raising of the paralyzed arm.\n",
      "Patients and method: Four observations of this movement, which is seldom described probably because it is mostly neglected, were made in the neurology unit of the University Hospital of Poitiers. The descriptions were compared with other cases that have been published in the medical literature of the last 150 years. Cerebral imagery shows a lesion that is most often localized on the internal capsule. After comparison with experimental models in cats, it is proposed that the section of the cortico-neocerebellum tract of the extra-pyramidal system disinhibits the spino-archeocerebellum tract, enabling a motor stimulation of the arm by the lateral reticular nucleus, which harmonises central respiratory and locomotor rhythms.\n",
      "Results and conclusion: Some subcortical structures, that are phylogenetically more ancient, thus disinhibit regained autonomy in the homeostasis process associating the massive inspiration of yawning--a form of reflex behavior that stimulates vigilance--with a motor control that is active during locomotion. For this phenomenon we coined the term \"parakinesia brachialis oscitans\".\n",

      "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) elicits grooming in the rat, but the neural organization of this response is still obscure. Electrical stimulation (EHS) in an area around the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH) also elicits grooming. This hypothalamic area contains many ACTH-immunoreactive fibres. Injection of ACTH1-24 (0.3 microgram/0.3 microliters) in the same area elicits intense grooming responses in the rat. Latency, intensity and precise patterning of the grooming response are dependent upon the exact site of injection. Comparison of grooming responses elicited by EHS, ACTH injected i.c.v. and ACTH injected in the PVH reveals that these are slightly dissimilar. This may provide clues as to the brain mechanisms involved in the organization of the different components of grooming. EHS does not elicits scratching and even reduces 'spontaneous' scratching. Also, EHS-elicited grooming is characterized by short pauses. The time-course of appearance of yawning differs between ACTH-PVH and ACTH-i.c.v. injections. Excited locomotion elicited only by ACTH-i.c.v. is apparently caused by ACTH-sensitive systems outside the PVH. The results suggest that the ACTH-containing part of the hypothalamus around the PVH is crucially involved in the organization of grooming behaviour. We believe that at this level in the brain, the subroutines of grooming, scratching and yawning are integrated into one skin maintenance behaviour.\n",

      "Methods: Sixteen asymptomatic subjects read silently for 30 minutes while polygraphic recordings, including electromyographic (EMG) activity from masticatory and leg muscles, chest respiratory movements, and the movements and sounds of larynx, were made with simultaneous audio-video monitoring. Orofacial behaviors were scored based on the polygraphic and audio-video records. The activity and duration of masseter EMG bursts were calculated for the types of orofacial behaviors.\n",
      "Results: The number of orofacial behaviors varied between subjects; swallowing was most frequently observed. Approximately half of the orofacial behaviors occurred closely with body movements. Of all masseter EMG bursts detected, 55% were associated with functional orofacial behaviors, while 45% were regarded as nonfunctional. More than 80% of these masseter bursts lasted for less than 2 seconds, with an activity less than 20% of maximal voluntary clenching. These values did not differ between the types of associated orofacial behaviors.\n",
      "Conclusion: Although the occurrence of spontaneous orofacial motor activity is variable, asymptomatic subjects can exhibit substantial masseter bursts during wakefulness that are not associated with functional orofacial behaviors. The use of physiological and audio-video records permits spontaneous orofacial behaviors to be specifically identified, thereby allowing nonfunctional masseter EMG activity to be differentiated from functional masseter EMG activity.\n",
      "Rationale: Cocaine-induced changes in D(2) receptors have been implicated in the expression of sensitized behavioral responses and addiction-like behaviors; however, the influence of D(3) receptors is less clear.\n",
      "Objectives: To characterize the effects of repeated cocaine administration on the sensitivity of rats to D(2)- and D(3)-mediated behaviors, as well as the binding properties of ventral striatal D(2)-like and D(3) receptors.\n",
      "Methods: Pramipexole was used to assess the sensitivity of rats to D(3)/D(2) agonist-induced yawning, hypothermia, and locomotor activity, 24 h, 72 h, 10, 21, and 42 days after repeated cocaine or saline administration. The locomotor effects of cocaine (42 day) and the binding properties of ventral striatal D(2)-like and D(3) receptors (24 h and 42 days) were also evaluated.\n",
      "Results: Cocaine-treated rats displayed an enhanced locomotor response to cocaine, as well as a progressive and persistent leftward/upward shift of the ascending limb (72 h-42 day) and leftward shift of the descending limb (42 days) of the pramipexole-induced yawning dose-response curve. Cocaine treatment also decreased B (max) and K (d) for D(2)-like receptors and increased D(3) receptor binding at 42 days. Cocaine treatment did not change pramipexole-induced hypothermia or locomotor activity or yawning induced by cholinergic or serotonergic agonists.\n",
      "Conclusions: These studies suggest that temporal differences exist in the development of cocaine-induced sensitization of D(3) and D(2) receptors, with enhancements of D(3)-mediated behavioral effects observed within 72 h and enhancements of D(2)-mediated behavioral effects apparent 42 days after cocaine. These findings highlight the need to consider changes in D(3) receptor function when thinking about the behavioral plasticity that occurs during abstinence from cocaine use.\n"

      "1. The effects of acute oral administration of carbaryl (10-80 mg/kg), a carbamate insecticide, on some experimental models for detecting dopaminergic activity were examined in rats. Also, serum biochemical variables following carbaryl treatments were determined. 2. Carbaryl (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of apomorphine-induced yawns and at dose of 80 mg/kg it prolonged the duration time of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Pretreatment with carbaryl failed to affect apomorphine-induced stereotypes. 3. Carbaryl significantly reduced blood cholinesterase activity and elevated blood glucose levels and SGOT and SGPT activities. 4. These results indicate that low oral doses of carbaryl can cause behavioral and toxicological effects in rats.\n",
      "Receptor priming is a recently discovered phenomenon by which receptor agonists produce abrupt and long-lived supersensitization of receptors. Induction of dopamine (DA) D2 receptor supersensitivity by the agonist quinpirole was discovered approximately 15 years ago, and was found to occur consistently if rats were treated repeatedly at daily or weekly or monthly intervals with low or high doses of quinpirole. In this review we summarize and discuss some of the major studies that underlie DA D2 receptor supersensitivity, describe behavioral processes that are known to be altered by DA D2 receptor supersensitivity, and discuss the importance of DA innervation on expression of enhanced behaviors. DA D2 receptor supersensitivity represents one of the neural mechanisms implicated in psychiatric disorders. Also, DA D2 receptor supersensitivity and increased DA D3 receptor expression are associated with motor dyskinesias, as in L-DOPA-treated Parkinson's disease patients. An understanding of receptor priming, a knowledge of the types of behavioral expression associated with DA D2 receptor supersensitivity, and an understanding of mechanisms associated with receptor supersensitization, can lead to improvements in the treatments of psychiatric and neurological disorders.\n",
      "Interactive effects of intracerebroventricular administration of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, amikacin and gentamicin, and different duration of lithium pretreatment on apomorphine-induced yawning were investigated in male rats. The study was designed to investigate whether the hypothesis that the aminoglycoside antibiotics, amikacin and gentamicin, via their effects on phosphoinositide pathways and calcium channel might influence dopaminergic mechanisms as manifested in the yawning effect. Lithium is known to interact with phosphoinositide metabolism and was also tested after chronic studies on the apomorphine yawning model. Subcutaneous administration of apomorphine (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) to rats induced yawning in a biphasic manner. However the maximum response was obtained by 0.2 mg/kg of the drug. Intracerebroventricular administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics amikacin (25 microg/rat) increased and gentamicin (10 and 20 microg/rat) decreased apomorphine-induced yawning. Pretreatment of animals with lithium (600 mg/l) in drinking water for 7, 14 and 21 days reduced yawning induced by apomorphine. Administration of lithium for 28 days did not induce any significant effect on yawning response. Amikacin and gentamicin function via the same mechanism on phosphoinositide cascade. Since amikacin and gentamicin did not affect the yawning response similarly, they apparently do not involve inositol trisphosphate level in the alterations of dopaminergic-induced yawning. Probably, the effect of lithium pretreatment on the number of yawns is also time-dependent and some tolerance to the inhibitory effect of lithium might occur after 28 days' treatment.\n",

      "Three experiments studied the effects of putative antagonists of opiate withdrawal in hamsters and rats. In Experiment 1, the calcium channel antagonists verapamil (20 mg/kg) and nifedipine (20 mg/kg) failed to antagonize naloxone (1 mg/kg)-precipitated withdrawal in hamsters implanted with two 75-mg morphine pellets, whereas clonidine (0.4 mg/kg), the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, blocked most withdrawal signs. In Experiment 2, clonidine (0.4 mg/kg) and verapamil (20 mg/kg) were tested against naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in hamsters made acutely dependent by a single injection of morphine (15 mg/kg). As in Experiment 1, clonidine but not verapamil was effective. In Experiment 3, the effects of verapamil on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal were studied in morphine-pelleted rats and hamsters. In rats implanted with two morphine pellets, verapamil (20 mg/kg) reversed naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. By contrast, in hamsters implanted with either one or two morphine pellets neither of two doses of verapamil (20 and 30 mg/kg) was effective. These results are discussed in terms of species' differences in sensitivity to calcium channel blockers.\n",
      "The effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, two inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, on apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning, was studied in male rats after intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration. Both compounds prevented dose-dependently apomorphine and oxytocin responses, when given systemically (5-50 mg/kg) or centrally (30-500 micrograms per rat), but NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was about 5 times more potent than NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. The D-isomer of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, which does not inhibit nitric oxide synthase, was ineffective. The results suggest that central nitric oxide is involved in the expression of penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine and oxytocin.\n",
      "Effects of terguride, a 9,10-dihydrogenated derivative of lisuride, on the central nervous system were investigated in rodents in comparison with those of lisuride. In vitro binding studies in rat brains showed that terguride, similar to lisuride, had a high affinity for D2-, 5-HT1A-, 5-HT2-, alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors. Terguride, as does lisuride, induced hypomotility and yawning at low doses in rats, suggesting its presynaptic D2-agonist action. Terguride, unlike the postsynaptic D2-agonist lisuride, induced neither hypermotility nor stereotypy in rats and guinea pigs, but suppressed the hypermotility and stereotypy induced by apomorphine. Terguride suppressed haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats and induced contralateral rotations in unilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, as does lisuride. These effects may be due to the postsynaptic D2 partial agonist action. Terguride, unlike lisuride, neither induced the serotonin syndrome nor generalized to the discriminative stimuli of the 5-HT1A- agonist 8-OH-DPAT in rats. Terguride did not induce head twitch in mice. Terguride blocked noradrenaline-induced lethality and clonidine-induced hypothermia at high doses in mice. Repeated administration of terguride did not affect the behavioral actions in rats. Thus, the effects of terguride on the central nervous system seems to be produced by mediation of the agonist and partial agonist actions at presynaptic and postsynaptic D2- receptors, respectively.\n",

      "1. Three experiments were conducted in the Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM) to assess the effects of the D1 agonist SKF-38393, the D2 agonist quinpirole, and the interaction of the D2 antagonists haloperidol with amphetamine or cocaine on the amount, the structure, and the unpredictability of micro-events of rat exploratory behavior. 2. SKF-38393 (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) did not change the amount of motor behavior indicated by the temporal scaling exponent alpha, a descriptor of the local degree of acting, during a 60 min exposure in the BPM. However, SKF-38393 (3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) significantly increased the spatial scaling exponent d, indicating an increased component of local circumscribed movements. 3. Quinpirole (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) produced a biphasic dose response with respect to the amount of motor behavior. Low doses (0.03, 0.1) significantly decreased the local degree of acting, whereas alpha returned to control group levels for higher doses (0.3, 1.0 mg/kg). The change in activity was accompanied by a significant increase of local movements, i.e. d was increased for the lower doses. 4. Haloperidol (15.0 micrograms/kg) reduced a slightly increased d measure for amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) treated animals and increased a significantly reduced d for cocaine (20.0 mg/kg) treated animals, without affecting the increases of motor activity induced by both treatments. 5. It is concluded that the structure of motor activity provides an important measure of unconditioned motor behavior, which can be affected independently of the typically measured amount of motor activity.\n"

      "Oxytocin (5, 20 and 100 ng) injected unilaterally into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) of male rats stereotaxically implanted with a microinjection cannula coupled to a microdialysis probe, induces penile erection and yawning that occur concomitantly with a dose-dependent increase in the extracellular concentration of glutamic acid, dopamine and its main metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenilacetic acid (DOPAC), and nitrites (NO2-) in the dialysate obtained from the BNST by intracerebral microdialysis. The responses induced by oxytocin (100 ng) were all abolished by the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2-Orn8-vasotocin (1 μg), and reduced by CNQX (1 μg), a competitive antagonist of the AMPA receptors, both given into the BNST 25 min before oxytocin. In contrast, (+) MK-801 (1 μg), a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, and SCH 23390 (1 μg), a selective dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, reduced penile erection and yawning, but not glutamic acid and dopamine increases in the BNST dialysate induced by oxytocin. Immunohistochemistry revealed oxytocin-labelled neuronal structures in close proximity to tyrosine hydroxylase-labelled neurons or nitric oxide synthase-labelled cell bodies surrounded by intense vesicular glutamate transporter1-stained synapses in BNST sections where oxytocin injections induce the above responses. Together, these findings show that oxytocin injected into the BNST induces penile erection and yawning by activating not only the glutamatergic (and nitrergic) but also the dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading in turn to the activation of neural pathways mediating penile erection and yawning.\n",
      "Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered quinpirole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (P)1 to P21. This drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the D2 receptor. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. One day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. Dopamine D2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a D2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced D2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. On the MWM place version, D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF, BDNF and ChAT that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in BDNF and ChAT in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment. These results show that olanzapine eliminates D2 receptor priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by D2 priming in the hippocampus.\n",
      "This review summarizes a growing body of biological, pharmacologic, and genetic data that support a role for dopamine in the pathophysiology of certain subtypes of migraine. Most migraine symptoms can be induced by dopaminergic stimulation. Moreover, there is dopamine receptor hypersensitivity in migraineurs, as demonstrated by the induction of yawning, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and other symptoms of a migraine attack by dopaminergic agonists at doses that do not affect nonmigraineurs. Conversely, dopamine receptor antagonists are effective therapeutic agents in migraine. Recent genetic data suggest that molecular variations within dopamine receptor genes play a modifying role in the pathophysiology of migraine with aura. Therefore, modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission should be considered in the therapeutic management of migraine.\n",

      "Our earlier studies showed that dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists have some central pharmacological effects. Flunarizine is considered to be a calcium channel antagonist; therefore this study was aimed at investigating the effect of flunarizine (given in single doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) in behavioural models in which calcium channel antagonists of the dihydropyridine type were previously studied. Flunarizine inhibited the apomorphine-induced stereotypy and yawning behaviour in rats. It decreased the hypothermia induced by a low dose of apomorphine in mice, but not that one induced by high dose of it. The quinpirole-induced hypothermia was also reduced. In the tests used for evaluation of the effect on the serotonergic system, flunarizine decreased the 5-HTP-induced head twitches and partly antagonized the fenfluramine- and quipazine-induced hyperthermias (at a high ambient temperature). In the forced swimming test flunarizine was inactive in mice and rats. The obtained results indicate that flunarizine exerts central antagonistic effects on the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and has no antidepressant activity. Flunarizine differs from calcium channel antagonists of the dihydropyridine type, which have no dopamine-antagonistic activity and show anti-depressant-like properties.\n",
      "Rationale: Amount and type of food can alter dopamine systems and sensitivity to drugs acting on those systems.\n",
      "Objectives: This study examined whether changes in body weight, food type, or both body weight and food type contribute to these effects.\n",
      "Methods: Rats had free or restricted access (increasing, decreasing, or maintaining body weight) to standard (5.7% fat) or high-fat (34.3%) chow.\n",
      "Results: In rats gaining weight with restricted or free access to high-fat chow, both limbs of the quinpirole yawning dose-response curve (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg) shifted leftward compared with rats eating standard chow. Restricting access to standard or high-fat chow (maintaining or decreasing body weight) decreased or eliminated quinpirole-induced yawning; within 1 week of resuming free feeding, sensitivity to quinpirole was restored, although the descending limb of the dose-response curve was shifted leftward in rats eating high-fat chow. These are not likely pharmacokinetic differences because quinpirole-induced hypothermia was not different among groups. PG01037 and L-741,626 antagonized the ascending and descending limbs of the quinpirole dose-response curve in rats eating high-fat chow, indicating D3 and D2 receptor mediation, respectively. Rats eating high-fat chow also developed insulin resistance.\n",
      "Conclusions: These results show that amount and type of chow alter sensitivity to a direct-acting dopamine-receptor agonist with the impact of each factor depending on whether body weight increases, decreases, or is maintained. These data demonstrate that feeding conditions, perhaps related to insulin and insulin sensitivity, profoundly impact the actions of drugs acting on dopamine systems.\n",
      "Low doses of the dopamine D3-preferring agonist 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) produce a behavioral profile that is opposite to that produced by the psychomotor stimulants cocaine and amphetamine. For example, low doses of 7-OH-DPAT produce conditioned place aversion and hypolocomotion, whereas psychomotor stimulants produce conditioned place preference (CPP) and hyperlocomotion. In experiment 1, the effects of low doses of 7-OH-DPAT (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) on d-amphetamine-induced (1 mg/kg) motor behaviors and CPP were assessed. In experiment 2, the effects of 0.1 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT on d-amphetamine (0-10 mg/kg) dose-response curves for the same behaviors were examined. During conditioning, drug injections were paired with a distinct compartment, whereas saline injections were paired with another compartment. Locomotion and headbobbing were measured following acute and repeated drug administration during conditioning and place conditioning was assessed 24 h following the last conditioning day. In experiment 1, d-amphetamine-induced locomotion was dose-dependently decreased by 7-OH-DPAT following repeated administration, which was probably due to the emergence of headbobbing, a behavior not observed with d-amphetamine alone. d-Amphetamine-CPP was not altered by co-administration of 0-0.03 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT, but was attenuated by co-administration of 0.1 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT. In experiment 2, 7-OH-DPAT co-administered with low doses of d-amphetamine (0-0.5 mg/kg) produced a decrease in locomotion following acute administration. However, 7-OH-DPAT produced sensitization of locomotion at the 0.5 mg/kg dose of d-amphetamine and an increase in headbobbing at the 0.5-10 mg/kg doses of d-amphetamine following repeated administration. In contrast, d-amphetamine-CPP was attenuated by co-administration of 7-OH-DPAT. These findings suggest that 0.1 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT attenuates the reinforcing effects of d-amphetamine despite enhancing stereotypic behaviors.\n"

      "We report a 62-year-old woman with a locked-in syndrome with bilateral masticatory spasms and persistent trismus, who was still able to yawn. A vascular malformation of the basilar artery-megadolichobasilar artery (fusiform aneurysm, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia) was determined to be the underlying cause of this rare combination of symptoms. A thrombus in the megadolichobasilaris as well as an almost total pontine infarction were demonstrated on CT- and MRI-scans. Thus, trismus may be associated with locked-in syndrome due to megadolichobasilar artery thrombus, although yawning is still possible.\n",
      "Numerous symptoms have been reported in the literature associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). However, it has not been stated what TMD symptoms are the most important and consistent and in turn, can be referred to as the gold standard or classic symptoms. The purpose of this study was: 1. To review the literature regarding TMD symptoms; 2. To compare so-called classic TMD symptoms with the symptoms of patients diagnosed as having TMD. Out of 52 consecutive patients, 40 were diagnosed as having TMD and were selected for this study. Forty non-TMD subjects served as a control group. A total range of subjective symptoms, from a self-administered TMD history form, was collected, but only so-called classic or the most common TMD symptoms were reported in this study. Results revealed that the major complaints of the TMD patients, including headaches, were similar to the suggested classic TMD symptoms derived from the literature.\n",
      "Intraventricular (i.c.v.) injection of d(CH2)5-Tyr(Me)-[Orn8]vasotocin, a potent oxytocin antagonist, antagonized in a dose-dependent manner (10-100 ng) penile erection and yawning induced by the systemic injection of apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg s.c.) or by the i.c.v. injection of oxytocin (30 ng). In contrast, the oxytocin antagonist, even at the dose of 10 micrograms, did not modify penile erection and yawning induced by the i.c.v. injection of ACTH-(1-24). These results suggest that apomorphine, but not ACTH-(1-24), induce penile erection and yawning by releasing oxytocin in some brain area.\n",
      "Eating a high fat diet can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dopamine system dysfunction. For example, rats eating high fat chow are more sensitive than rats eating standard chow to the behavioral effects (e.g., locomotion and yawning) of dopaminergic drugs (e.g., quinpirole and cocaine). Daily dietary supplementation with 20% (w/w) fish oil prevents high fat diet-induced enhanced sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning and cocaine-induced locomotion; however, doctors recommend that patients take fish oil just two to three times a week. To test the hypothesis that intermittent (i.e., 2 days per week) dietary supplementation with fish oil prevents high fat diet-induced enhanced sensitivity to quinpirole and cocaine, rats eating standard chow (17% kcal from fat), high fat chow (60% kcal from fat), and rats eating standard or high fat chow with 20% (w/w) intermittent (e.g., 2 days per week) dietary fish oil supplementation were tested once weekly with quinpirole [0.0032-0.32 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] or cocaine (1.0-17.8 mg/kg, i.p.) using a cumulative dosing procedure. Consistent with previous reports, eating high fat chow enhanced sensitivity of rats to the behavioral effects of quinpirole and cocaine. Intermittent dietary supplementation of fish oil prevented high fat chow-induced enhanced sensitivity to dopaminergic drugs in male and female rats. Future experiments will focus on understanding the mechanism(s) by which fish oil produces these beneficial effects.\n",
      "Several animal models are currently used in erectile (dys)function research; these models fail to account for the conditions involving the more spontaneous erections in humans. Recently, we observed an increase in the number of 'spontaneously' occurring erections in rats with previous exposure to apomorphine (APO), a centrally acting drug that initiates penile erections and yawns. Based on this observation, we designed a series of experiments to characterize the development of enhanced, non-apomorphine-induced erections or 'spontaneous' erectile responses to vehicle administration in rats with previous exposure to APO. We further examined the effects of castration on these conditioned erections. Naive (ie never received APO) rats were administered vehicle (1 ml/kg saline) to determine the frequency of baseline erections and yawns. An alternating series of APO (80 microg/kg s.c.) and vehicle administrations were performed over several days and subsequent erectile and yawning responses were recorded. Following 3 sets of 3 APO administrations (with vehicle administered between sets), and the 3rd vehicle administration, these rats were then surgically castrated and allowed 30 days to recover. Following this, APO was administered 3 times to determine erectile and yawning responses post-castration, followed by vehicle administration to determine the effects of castration on conditioned APO responses. The major findings were: (1) that although naive rats had a basal spontaneous erectile response (0.75 +/- 0.88; 4 of 8 rats with at least one erection), repetitive administration (up to 22 treatments) of the central initiator apomorphine significantly increased the number of erections (1.8 +/- 0.7; 7 of 8 rats with at least one erection) and yawning (2.5 +/- 2.47) responses to vehicle administration; and (2) both spontaneous yawning and erectile responses were found to be androgen dependent since castration dramatically lowered the number of erections (0.13 +/- 0.35; 1 of 8 rats with at least one erection) and yawns (0). Therefore, this method of producing erections without a pharmacological manipulation provides an additional animal model which can be used in conjunction with the APO-induced erections in characterizing the physiology and pathophysiology of erectile function in conscious rats.\n",
      "A dose of oxytocin (50 ng i.c.v.) that induces penile erection and yawning, increased the concentration of NO2- from 0.98 +/- 0.29 to 4.2 +/- 0.79 microM and of NO3- from 5.6 +/- 0.33 to 12.03 +/- 0.99 microM in the dialysate from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of male rats, as measured by in vivo microdialysis. NO2- concentration was also increased by [Thr4, Gly7]-oxytocin (100 ng i.c.v. and oxytocin(8) (1 microgram i.c.v.) which also induced penile erection and yawning, but not by oxytocin(1-6) (1 microgram i.c.v.) or oxytocin (7-9) 1 microgram i.c.v.), which were unable to induce these behavioral responses. The oxytocin effect on NO2 concentration, penile erection and yawning was prevented by the oxytocin receptor antagonist. d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin (1 microgram i.e.v.) or by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-1-arginine methyl ester (200 micrograms i.c.v.), but not by the dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). The nitric oxide scavenger, hemoglobin (200 micrograms i.c.v.), prevented oxytocin-induced NO2- concentration increase, but was unable to prevent penile erection and yawning. Methylene blue (300 micrograms i.c.v.) an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, was ineffective on oxytocin-induced NO2- concentration increase, but prevented the behavioral responses. The results suggest that oxytocin induces penile erection and yawning by increasing nitric oxide synthase activity in the cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas and mediating the behavioral responses.\n",
      "Amphetamine (AMPH)-induced sensitization of central dopamine (DA) receptors, produced by repeated AMPH treatments, is associated with increased AMPH-induced DA release in the rat forebrain. However, for DA receptor sensitization produced by repeated DA receptor agonist treatments, the effects on forebrain DA release are not known. The objective of our study was to determine this. DA receptor sensitization was produced by administering the DA D2 agonist quinpirole (50 microg/kg/day) to rats, from the 1st to 11th days after birth - a process known as 'priming'. When these rats were tested at 3 months, DA receptor sensitization was manifested as increased quinpirole-induced yawning. We also found that AMPH (1.0 mg/kg, ip) acutely induced a 5-fold greater increase in DA content in the neostriatal in vivo microdialysate of these quinpirole-primed rats (vs. controls), accompanied by a reduction in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in the microdialysate. Conversely, an acute injection of quinpirole x HCl (100 microg/kg, ip) reduced the microdialysate contents of DA, DOPAC and HVA to comparable levels in quinpirole-primed and control rats. Therefore, we can conclude that long-lived DA receptor sensitization, produced by repeated DA D2 agonist treatments in ontogeny, is associated with enhanced AMPH-induced DA release in the neostriatum in adulthood, but is not accompanied by evident alteration in quinpirole-induced DA release.\n"

      "A dose of apomorphine or oxytocin that induces penile erection and yawning increases nitric oxide production in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, as determined by the increase in NO2- and NO3- concentration induced by these substances in the paraventricular dialysate obtained from male rats. All the above responses were prevented by a dose of omega-conotoxin-GVIA as low as 5 ng. This potent inhibitor of N-type Ca2+ channels was injected into the paraventricular nucleus 15 min before apomorphine (50 ng) or oxytocin (10 ng). In contrast, omega-conotoxin was ineffective when the above responses were induced by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (50 ng). The peptide toxin (5 ng) was also ineffective on the penile erection and yawning induced by the nitric oxide donors sodium nitroprusside (50 microg) or hydroxylamine (50 microg), injected into the paraventricular nucleus. The present results suggest that omega-conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ channels are involved in the activation of nitric oxide synthase, penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine and oxytocin, but not by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, at the paraventricular level.\n",
      "The effects of the systemic (i.p.) administration of the selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and the selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist sodium 2-p-carboxyethyl)phenylamino-5'-N-carboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680) on different dopamine receptor agonist-induced behaviours were studied in the male rat. CGS 21680 (1 micromol/kg), but not CPA, was found to counteract the stereotypies induced by the non-selective dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg s.c.). Low doses of CGS 21680 (0.1 micromol/kg) and high doses of CPA (3 micromol/kg) counteracted yawning induced by the dopamine D2 selective agonist quinpirole (0.05 mg/kg). On the other hand, low doses of CPA (0.3 micromol/kg) antagonized grooming induced by the selective dopamine D1 receptor-selective agonist SKF 38393 (10 mg/kg i.p.), while CGS 21680 was ineffective. These results are consistent with the proposed existence of a selective antagonistic modulation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors by adenosine A1 and A2A receptors, respectively. The ability of CGS 21680 to counteract apomorphine-induced stereotypies is weaker compared to its previously reported antagonistic effect of amphetamine-induced motor activity. This supports the hypothesis that adenosine A2A receptor agonists may be potential antipsychotic drugs with a low potential for extrapyramidal side effects.\n",
      "The effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ACTH 1-24 (1, 5 and 10 micrograms) or the subcutaneous administration of apomorphine (20 and 80 micrograms/kg SC) on spontaneous penile erection and yawning was studied in rats treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a treatment that depletes hypothalamic ACTH, alpha-MSH and endorphin-like peptides. Neonatal MSG treatment failed to antagonize either apomorphine- or ACTH-induced yawning in male and female rats, or to alter the number of penile erection episodes induced by the two substances in male rats. In contrast, hypophysectomy, that does not alter the concentration of hypothalamic ACTH and alpha-MSH, caused a marked prevention of apomorphine- and ACTH-induced responses, in agreement with previous studies. The results suggest that the integrity of opiomelanotropinergic neurons in the hypothalamus is not necessary for the induction of yawning and penile erection by ACTH-derived peptides, and that apomorphine and other dopamine agonists apparently do not induce penile erection and yawning by releasing an ACTH-derived peptide in brain.\n",
      "Behavioral effects of setiptiline, a new tetracyclic compound (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-9H-dibenzo [3,4:6,7] cyclohepta [1,2-C] pyridine maleate), were investigated to determine its pharmacological characteristics as an antidepressant in rats and mice, as compared with amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, and promethazine, a neuroleptic possessing an antihistaminic profile. Setiptiline exerted a weak stimulatory action on ambulation, spontaneous motor-activity, observed by the open field method in rats and potentiated the stimulatory effects of methamphetamine. Setiptiline also shortened the duration of immobility in rats forced to swim and inhibited catalepsy induced by haloperidol, yawning by physostigmine, body shaking as well as head twitch by 5-hydroxytryptophan in combination with Ro4-4602 and body shaking by morphine-withdrawal in rats. On the other hand, the drug did not exhibit an antagonistic effect on the hypothermia produced by reserpine in mice. From the results, it is suggested that setiptiline seems to have antidepressive activities that are pharmacologically dissimilar to those of tricyclic antidepressants.\n",

      "The behavioural effects induced in male Wistar rats by SND 919, a new drug reputed to have selective agonistic activity at D2 dopamine (DA) receptors, were studied. The following aspects of behaviour were considered: motor activity, stretching-yawning (SY), penile erection (PE) and stereotyped behaviour (SB). Intraperitoneal injection (IP) of the drug (0.01-20 mg/kg) induced an SY syndrome in the form of a bell-shaped dose-response curve, the effect being maximal at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg and disappearing completely at 10 mg/kg. SND 919 also potently elicited PE; this latter effect, however, was not coincident with SY induction, being maximal at 1 mg/kg and persisting at 10 and 20 mg/kg. SND 919-induced SY was potently antagonized by pretreatment not only with the D2 antagonist, L-sulpiride (20 mg/kg), but also with the alpha 2 antagonist, yohimbine (1, 3 mg/kg), and the more selective alpha 2 antagonist, idazoxan (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg). While sulpiride also decreased SND 919-induced PE, idazoxan at all doses and yohimbine at 1 mg/kg did not affect this behaviour. Inhibition of motor activity was induced by the D2 agonist at low doses (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg), while at high doses (1, 10 and 20 mg/kg), it was actually replaced by a form of SB characterized by downward sniffing and licking. When, for comparison, the D2 agonist, RU 24213 (0.1-20 mg/kg IP), was tested for PE, SY, motor activity and SB, it displayed a behavioural pattern very similar to that obtained with SND 919. Idazoxan (2 mg/kg), administered before RU 24213 (10 mg/kg), significantly antagonized the drug-induced SY, but not PE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Sexual motivation and behavior decreased in male cynomolgus monkeys given either Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate, MPA), which reduces androgen uptake by brain, or the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, Fadrozole, which virtually eliminates the conversion of testosterone (T) to estradiol (E2) in brain. This suggested that both unchanged T and E2 are important for the control of male primate sexual behavior, but combined treatment with MPA and Fadrozole did not have the anticipated summatory effects in intact males: the behavioral decrements when MPA-treated males were given Fadrozole were about half those observed when Fadrozole was given alone. The present study tested the hypothesis that Fadrozole suppressed the behavioral effects of MPA by preventing the induction by E2 of progestin receptors in the brain to which MPA binds. Eight castrated, T-treated males were each tested with an estrogenized female i) during baseline, ii) during MPA treatment, iii) during treatment with MPA and Fadrozole together, and iv) with E2 treatment added to condition (iii) (256 1-h behavior tests). All dosages were those used in previous studies. Sexual motivation, as reflected in mounting attempts and mounting attempt latencies, was further diminished by E2 treatment in males receiving both MPA and Fadrozole, but ejaculatory activity was not changed. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the distributions of progestin and androgen receptors were little affected by MPA treatment, and that progestin receptor immunoreactivity was almost completely abolished in the brains of males receiving both MPA and Fadrozole but present in those receiving additional E2 treatment, findings that supported the hypothesis.\n"

      "The effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NAME), a potent inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, injected into different brain areas on penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine or oxytocin was studied in male rats. The compound was found to be able to prevent the above behavioral responses dose dependently when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), but not in the caudate nucleus, medial septum, preoptic area, and the CA1 field of the hippocampus. When injected in the PVN, 5 micrograms of NAME induced a 30% reduction of apomorphine and oxytocin responses, while 20 micrograms induced an almost complete reduction. The effect of NAME seems to be related to the inhibition of guanylate cyclase secondary to the prevention of NO formation, because a dose-dependent reduction of apomorphine and oxytocin responses was obtained also with the inhibitor of guanylate cyclase methylene blue injected intracerebroventricularly (100-400 micrograms ICV), but not into the PVN. The results provide further support for a neurotransmitter role of central NO in the control of penile erection and yawning.\n",
      "Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil displays prophylactic effects against intoxication with irreversible organophosphorous acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. We used behavioural observation of yawning and epileptic seizures, histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining, and in situ hybridization of the immediate early genes, c-fos and synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4) mRNAs in the brain, to evaluate whether donepezil could protect the brain against the effects of the organophosphate anticholinesterase, diisopropylfluorophosphate, in a rat model of intoxication. Diisopropylfluorophosphatetreated animals exhibited frequent yawning, significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase staining and upregulation of c-fos mRNA, but not the epileptic seizures or significant change of Syt4 mRNA levels. In order to reduce the threshold for the induction of cholinergic seizures, additional groups of rats were pre-treated with LiCl 24 h before the treatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate. These rats exhibited the seizures, a significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase staining and significant upregulation of c-fos and Syt4 mRNA levels. All the above-mentioned effects of diisopropylfluorophosphate were inhibited by donepezil pre-treatment. Donepezil pre-treatment by itself induced only a comparatively weaker inhibition of acetylcholinesterase staining and infrequent yawning. We conclude that donepezil protects the brain against diisopropylfluorophosphate-induced effects and that Syt4 mRNA upregulation may serve as a novel marker for organophosphate-induced seizures.\n",
      "The in vivo effects of administration of the putative dopamine D3 receptor agonist 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propylaminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY). The i.p. injection of 7-OH-DPAT induced hyperactivity in WKY at 10 mg/kg, but only an inhibition of exploratory locomotor activity was observed in SHR at 1 mg/kg. In WKY and SHR with unilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal system, s.c. injection of 0.01-1 mg/kg of 7-OH-DPAT induced dose-dependent contralateral turning behaviour. This response was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. The s.c. injection of 0.03, but not of 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg, of 7-OH-DPAT induced yawning in WKY and SHR. The i.v. injection of 0.1 or 1 mg/kg of 7-OH-DPAT induced an immediate rise in blood pressure in both WKY and SHR. Pretreatment with the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol partially prevented this pressor response and, in addition, unmasked a late fall in blood pressure in SHR. The s.c. injection of 1 mg/kg of 7-OH-DPAT induced a decrease in body temperature, which was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. This effect could be inhibited by pretreatment with haloperidol, but a residual hypothermia remained in SHR. These results suggest that 7-OH-DPAT induces a variety of effects in vivo, many of which may be mediated by dopamine D2 receptors or non-dopaminergic receptors. Thus, more selective dopamine D3 receptor agonists or -antagonists are needed to further explore the role of dopamine D3 receptors in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "The D2 autoreceptor agonist B-HT 958, intraperitoneally injected into Wistar male rats in a novel environment, significantly increased stretching and yawning (SY) while inhibiting grooming. Pretreatment with the D2 antagonist sulpiride reversed these effects, antagonizing SY and restoring grooming. Similarly, when B-HT 958 was administered to rats in their home cages, it elicited SY and abolished grooming; moreover, when administered before the i.c.v. injection of adrenocorticotropin hormone, dose-dependently enhanced SY and strongly antagonized the typical syndrome of intensified grooming induced by the peptide. The possible relationship between SY and grooming and the involvement of D2 autoreceptors are discussed.\n",

      "To identify behaviors associated with the onset of gastroesophageal reflux episodes in infants both systematically and prospectively, each of 10 patients (aged 2 to 32 weeks) was studied during 2 hours of intraluminal esophageal pH probe monitoring, using a split-screen audiovisual recording technique. Videotape analysis of eight infants who had scoreable reflux events revealed six discrete behaviors closely associated temporally (P < .001 to < .05) with the onset of reflux events: \"discomfort\" (crying or frowning), \"emission\" (of liquid or gas, i.e., regurgitation, drooling, or burping), yawning, stridor, stretching, and mouthing. Three behaviors (hiccuping, sneezing, and thumb-sucking) were infrequent but were significantly associated with onset of reflux events in one or two patients each. A tenth behavior, coughing or gagging, was significantly associated with onset of reflux events in two patients, but not in the rest, despite relatively frequent occurrence. Exploration of temporal relations between reflux and each behavior suggested that discomfort, emission, mouthing, and cough-gag may have caused reflux episodes, and that all 10 of the behaviors may have been caused by reflux episodes. These findings and a \"quiet period\" immediately preceding episodes in six of the infants suggest interesting pathophysiologic mechanisms in infants which require further evaluation.\n",
      "Facial baroparesis is an ischemic neurapraxia of the facial nerve. It occurs after airplane trips or prolonged diving. This paralysis is due to the tympanic promontory. Several promoting factors have been identified, including tubal dysfunction, hypotension, and neurotropic virus. Simple maneuvers can make it disappear: yawning, swallowing, or a Toynbee maneuver. Treatment is based on normobaric or even hyperbaric oxygen therapy. During airplane flights, the paralysis often disappears at landing.\n",
      "In order to provide further support for a role of central nitric oxide as a mediator of penile erection and yawning, the nitric oxide donors sodium nitroprusside, hydroxylamine, isoamyl nitrite and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine were injected into the lateral ventricles (i.c.v.) or into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of male rats. Of the above compounds injected i.c.v., only isoamyl nitrite (10-100 micrograms) induced penile erection and yawning, while the others induced dramatic behavioral changes, such as motor hyperactivity and convulsions, that masked the above responses. Nevertheless, nitric oxide donors in doses ranging from 10 to 50 micrograms, for except S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine that was injected only at the dose of 10 micrograms and isoamyl nitrite that was not injected at all because of poor solubility, induced penile erection and yawning when injected in the paraventricular nucleus. Nitric oxide donor-induced responses were prevented by methylene blue and LY 83583, inhibitors of guanylate cyclase, the best known target of nitric oxide, given i.c.v. but not in the paraventricular nucleus. However, 8-bromo-guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a stable cGMP analog, and hemoglobin, a nitric oxide scavenger, were ineffective in inducing and preventing, respectively, penile erection and yawning when injected either i.c.v. or in the paraventricular nucleus. Nitric oxide donor-induced responses were also prevented by the nonapeptide oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5-Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin given i.c.v. but not in the paraventricular nucleus. The present results suggest that nitric oxide donors induce penile erection and yawning by activating central oxytocinergic transmission in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus via a cGMP-independent mechanism.\n"

      "Increasing evidence suggests that trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is an important modulator of the dopaminergic system. Existing molecular evidence indicates that TAAR1 regulates dopamine levels through interactions with dopamine transporters and D2 receptors. However, investigations to date have not been exhaustive and other pathways may be involved. In this study, we used a well-described set of behaviors, quinpirole-induced yawning and hypothermia, to explore the potential interaction of TAAR1 and D3 receptors, which are members of the 'D2-like' dopamine receptor subfamily. Previous studies have shown that for D2/D3 receptor agonists, the induction of yawning is a D3 receptor-mediated effect, whereas the inhibition of yawning and induction of hypothermia are D2 receptor-mediated effects. Quinpirole produced an inverted U-shaped dose-effect curve for yawning, which was shifted downward dose-dependently by each of the TAAR1 agonists RO5263397 and RO5166017. Quinpirole also produced dose-dependent hypothermia, which was not affected by either TAAR1 agonist. These results suggest that TAAR1 agonists may interact with D3 receptors and/or its downstream pathways, as opposed to D2 receptors. These findings may shed light on a previously unexplored possibility for the mechanism of TAAR1-mediated effects.\n",

      "The present experiments were performed to examine the effects of a new muscarinic M1-receptor agonist, (-)-YM796 ((-)-S-2,8-dimethyl-3-methylene-1-oxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane L-tartrate monohydrate), on yawning and oxytocin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland in rats YM796, at doses of 2.5-50 mg/kg (SC), elicited yawning. The yawning response was markedly increased by pretreatment with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol (20 mg/kg, IP), which per se did not elicit yawning. The yawning induced by YM796 (10 mg/kg, SC) in combination with pindolol (20 mg/kg, IP) was inhibited by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, and pirenzcpine (300 micrograms/ rat, ICV) and EEDQ (N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline) (5 mg/kg, IP), muscarinic M1-receptor antagonists, but not by spiperone (0.5 mg/kg, SC), a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide) (100 micrograms/rat, ICV), a muscarinic M3-receptor antagonist, and [d(CH2)5, Tyr(Mc)2, Orn8]-vasotocin (100 ng/rat, ICV), an oxytocin receptor antagonist. YM796 at 2.5-50 mg/kg (SC) did not exert an action on prolactin levels but increased oxytocin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland in rats. This augmentation of oxytocin secretion by YM796 was inhibited by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, SC) and pirenzepine (3 mg/kg, SC), but not by mecamylamine (1 mg/kg, IP), a nicotinic receptor antagonist. The present findings obtained with YM796 suggest that the muscarinic M2-receptor stimulation participates in causing yawning behavior and oxytocin secretion in rats.\n",
      "Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is a collective term embracing a number of clinical problems, which involve the masticatory musculature, the temporomandibular joint or both. Virtually all theories dealing with the aetiology and treatment of TMD have recognized the importance of psychological factors. This paper reports the development of a computerized on-line program (NUS TMD v1.1) for the diagnosis of pain-related disability and psychological status of TMD patients based on Axis II of the research diagnostic criteria (RDC)/TMD (Dworkin, S.F. & LeResche, L. 1992. Journal of Craniomandibular Disorders: Facial Oral Pain, 6, 301), which was developed to redress the lack of diagnostic criteria in TMD research. Methods adopted by RDC/TMD for use in assessing Axis II status include a seven-item questionnaire for grading chronic pain severity, the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R) and a jaw disability checklist. A pilot study, based on 37 new TMD patient records, was conducted to study the pain-related disability and psychological status of TMD patients using this newly developed program. The mean age of the predominantly Chinese population (86.5%) was 32.19 years (range 20-72 years) with a sex distribution of 24 females and 13 males. Most patients (78%) had low disability, with 12 patients having low intensity and 17 patients having high intensity pain. Approximately 73% of the sample population were moderately or severely depressed. Patients that were moderately and severely depressed had significantly higher scores for limitation related to mandibular functioning than normal patients. The three most frequent jaw disabilities were: eating hard foods (84%), yawning (78%) and chewing (65%).\n",
      "The relationship between facial morphology and jaw function remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in self-reported oral behaviour habits between individuals with normodivergent and hyperdivergent facial types. Some 80 cases and controls were individually matched on age, sex ethnicity and treatment stage. The participants were recruited from an orthodontic clinic, and included both adolescents and adults. Habitual oral activity was assessed using the Oral Behaviour Checklist (OBC) based on their experiences in the past 4 weeks. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed. The sample had a mean age of 17·2 years (SD = 4·6; range = 12-49 years), and was predominantly female (65·0%) and of New Zealand European origin (91·3%). The prevalence of reporting one or more frequently performed habitual muscular behaviour in either study group was over 85% (P > 0·05). There was no difference in total OBC score between the hyperdivergent (25·6; SD: 9·0) and normodivergent group (25·3; SD: 9·9). Moreover, there was no difference in the prevalence of either nocturnal or daytime oral behaviours between the two groups. While this study did not include any objective measures of functional or habitual activity, we found no differences in self-reported oral behaviour habits between normodivergent and hyperdivergent individuals. The findings do not support an association between vertical facial form and habitual muscular activity.\n",
      "Background: Although nurse clinicians and researchers use infant behaviors to indicate the responses of preterm infant to stimulation, little is known about how the biological factors of development, sleeping and waking states, infant characteristics, and infant illness severity affect preterm infant behaviors.\n",
      "Objective: This study examined the development of eight infant behaviors over the preterm period and determined the relation of these behaviors to sleeping and waking and to infant characteristics and illness severity.\n",
      "Methods: Seventy-one preterm infants were observed once per week from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. from the time they were no longer critical until term or discharge. The occurrence of four sleep-wake states and eight behaviors were recorded every 10 seconds during the observations.\n",
      "Results: Negative facial expressions increased over the preterm period; sighs, startle/jerks, jitters, and the likelihood of having hiccups decreased. Infant characteristics had only minor effects: boys had more negative facial expressions, and longer mechanical ventilation was associated with more sighs and jitters. All behaviors showed state-related differences in frequency. In addition, only startle/jerks and jitters showed the same developmental patterns within each state.\n",
      "Conclusions: Significant development of infant behaviors occurs over the preterm period but involves changes not only in the absolute percentage of each behavior but also in the percentages within each sleeping and waking state. Thus, preterm infant behaviors cannot be used clinically for assessment without consideration of the state in which they occur.\n",

Next, D(3) receptor function was assessed by measuring quinpirole-induced yawning (0.03-0.3 mg/kg). Finally, D1-like receptor function was examined by measuring eye blinking elicited by the high-efficacy D1-like receptor agonist SKF81297 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg).\n",
      "Results: There were no differences between groups or sexes in D2-like receptor availability in the caudate nucleus, putamen or amygdala. However, quinpirole elicited significantly more yawns in prenatally cocaine-exposed monkeys compared with control monkeys. A significant correlation between gestational dose of cocaine and peak effects of quinpirole was observed. In all monkeys, administration of SKF81297 elicited dose-dependent increases in eye blinks that did not differ between groups.\n",

      "Abnormal yawning is an underappreciated phenomenon in patients with ischemic stroke. We aimed at identifying frequently affected core regions in the supratentorial brain of stroke patients with abnormal yawning and contributing to the anatomical network concept of yawning control. Ten patients with acute anterior circulation stroke and ≥3 yawns/15 min without obvious cause were analyzed. The NIH stroke scale (NIHSS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), symptom onset, period with abnormal yawning, blood oxygen saturation, glucose, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) were assessed for all patients. MRI lesion maps were segmented on diffusion-weighted images, spatially normalized, and the extent of overlap between the different stroke patterns was determined. Correlations between the period with abnormal yawning and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the overlapping regions, total stroke volume, NIHSS and mRS were performed. Periods in which patients presented with episodes of abnormal yawning lasted on average for 58 h. Average GCS, NIHSS, and mRS scores were 12.6, 11.6, and 3.5, respectively. Clinical parameters were within normal limits. Ischemic brain lesions overlapped in nine out of ten patients: in seven patients in the insula and in seven in the caudate nucleus. The decrease of the ADC within the lesions correlated with the period with abnormal yawing (r = -0.76, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.02). The stroke lesion intensity of the common overlapping regions in the insula and the caudate nucleus correlates with the period with abnormal yawning. The insula might be the long sought-after brain region for serotonin-mediated yawning.\n",

      "Eating a diet high in fat can lead to negative health consequences, including obesity and insulin resistance. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as those found in fish oil) prevent high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in rats. Eating a high fat diet also enhances sensitivity of rats to the behavioral effects of drugs that act on dopamine systems (e.g. quinpirole, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist). To test the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with fish oil prevents high fat diet-induced enhanced sensitivity to the behavioral effects of quinpirole (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg), male rats ate standard laboratory chow, high fat chow, standard chow with fish oil, or high fat chow with fish oil (20% w/w). After 5 weeks, rats eating high fat chow were more sensitive (e.g. leftward shift of the quinpirole dose-response curve) than rats eating standard chow to yawning induced by quinpirole. Dietary supplementation with fish oil prevented this effect. That is, quinpirole dose-response curves were not different between rats eating high fat chow supplemented with fish oil and standard chow fed controls. These data add to a growing literature showing the complex relationship between diet and dopamine systems, and the health benefits of fish oil.\n",
      "Amygdala dysfunction and abnormal fear and stress reactivity are common features of several developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, little is known about the exact role the amygdala plays in the development of threat detection and emotional modulation. The current study examined the effects of neonatal amygdala lesions on defensive, emotional, and neuroendocrine reactivity of infant rhesus monkeys reared with their mothers in large species-typical social groups. Monkeys received either bilateral MRI-guided ibotenic acid amygdala (Neo-A; n = 16) or sham (Neo-C; n = 12) lesions at 24.8 ± 1.2 days of age, or served as behavioral control (Neo-BC; n = 3). Defensive and emotional responses were assessed using the Human Intruder paradigm as infants and as juveniles (2.5 and 12 months of age, respectively), whereas neuroendocrine reactivity was only examined during the juvenile period. As infants, Neo-A animals expressed similar levels of freezing and hostile behaviors as compared to controls, whereas during the juvenile period Neo-A animals expressed significantly less freezing compared to controls. Interestingly, the sex of the infant modulated the behavioral effects of neonatal amygdalectomy, leading to different patterns of behavior depending on the sex and lesion status of the infant. Unlike controls, Neo-A infants did not modulate their behavioral responses based on the salience of the threat. The impact of neonatal amygdalectomy increased with age, such that Neo-A juveniles exhibited fewer emotional behaviors and increased cortisol response to the stressor as compared to controls. These data indicate that the amygdala plays a critical role in the development of both emotional and neuroendocrine reactivity as well as the expression of sexually dimorphic emotional expression.\n",
      "The dopamine D₃ preferring agonist pramipexole (50 ng) induced penile erection and yawning when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of male rats, like the mixed D₁/D₂-like agonist apomorphine (50 ng), while the D₄ agonist PD 168,077 (100 ng), induced penile erection only. These responses lasted for 45-60 min and occurred with an increase of NO₂- and NO₃- concentrations in the dialysate obtained from the paraventricular nucleus by intracerebral microdialysis. Pramipexole and apomorphine responses were reduced by the D₂ preferring antagonist L-741,626 (5 μg), but not by the D₃ preferring antagonist SB-277011A (10 μg), or the D₄ preferring antagonist L-745,870 (5 μg), injected into the PVN before the dopamine agonist. In contrast, PD 168,077 responses were reduced by L-745,870, but not by L-741,626 or SB-277011A. Pramipexole, apomorphine and PD 168,077 effects were also reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (20 μg) and the N-type voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels blocker ω-conotoxin (5 ng), given into the paraventricular nucleus, and by the oxytocin antagonist d(CH₂)₅Tyr(Me)²-Orn⁸-vasotocin (2 μg), given intracerebroventricularly but not into the paraventricular nucleus before dopamine agonists. These results suggest that stimulation of D₂, but not D₃ or D₄ receptors, by pramipexole or apomorphine increases Ca²⁺ influx in cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons. This increases the production of nitric oxide, which activates oxytocinergic neurotransmission in extra-hypothalamic brain areas and spinal cord, leading to penile erection and yawning. However, the stimulation of D₄ receptors by PD 168,077 also increases Ca²⁺ influx/nitric oxide production leading to penile erection, but not yawning.\n",
      "(1R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (lorcaserin) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treating obesity, and its therapeutic effects are thought to result from agonist activity at serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors. Lorcaserin has affinity for other 5-HT receptor subtypes, although its activity at those subtypes is not fully described. The current study compared the behavioral effects of lorcaserin (0.0032-32.0 mg/kg) to the effects of other 5-HT receptor selective agonists in rats (n = 8). The 5-HT2C receptor selective agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP, 0.032-1.0 mg/kg) and lorcaserin induced yawning which was attenuated by the 5-HT2C receptor selective antagonist 6-chloro-5-methyl-N-(6-[(2-methylpyridin-3-yl)oxy]pydidin-3-yl)indoline-1-carboxamide (1.0 mg/kg). The 5-HT2A receptor selective agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (0.1-3.2 mg/kg) induced head twitching, which was attenuated by the 5-HT2A receptor selective antagonist R-(+)-2,3-dimethoxyphenyl-1-[2-(4-piperidine)-methanol] (MDL 100907, 0.01 mg/kg), lorcaserin (3.2 mg/kg), and mCPP (3.2 mg/kg). In rats pretreated with MDL 100907 (1.0 mg/kg), lorcaserin also induced head twitching. At larger doses, lorcaserin produced forepaw treading, which was attenuated by the 5-HT1A receptor selective antagonist N-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (0.178 mg/kg). While the behavioral effects of lorcaserin in rats are consistent with it having agonist activity at 5-HT2C receptors, these data suggest that at larger doses it also has agonist activity at 5-HT2A and possibly 5-HT1A receptors. Mounting evidence suggests that 5-HT2C receptor agonists might be effective for treating drug abuse. A more complete description of the activity of lorcaserin at 5-HT receptor subtypes will facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate its therapeutic effects.\n"

      "Dopamine (DA) is implicated in penile erection (PE) and yawning (YA) in rats through activation of D2-like receptors. However, the exact role of each subtype (D2, D3 and D4) of this receptor family in PE/YA is still not clearly elucidated. We recorded concomitantly PE and YA after treatment with agonists with various levels of selectivity for the different subtypes of D2-like receptors. In addition, we investigated the efficacy of antagonists with selective or preferential affinity for each of the three receptor subtypes to prevent apomorphine-induced PE and YA. Wistar rats were more sensitive than Long-Evans rats to the erectogenic activity of the nonselective DA agonist apomorphine (0.01-0.08 mg/kg), whereas Sprague-Dawley rats were insensitive. However, all the three strains were equally sensitive to apomorphine-induced YA. In Wistar rats, apomorphine (0.01-0.63 mg/kg), the D2/D3 agonists quinelorane and (+)7-OH-DPAT (0.000625-10 mg/kg) or PD 128,907 (0.01-10 mg/kg), but not the D4 agonists PD-168,077, RO-10-5824 and ABT-724 (0.04-0.63 mg/kg), produced PE and YA with bell-shaped dose-response curves. Similarly, ABT-724 and CP226-269 (another D4 agonist) failed to elicit PE and YA in Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, in Wistar rats, PE and YA elicited by apomorphine (0.08 mg/kg) were not modified by selective D3 (S33084 and SB-277011, 0.63-10 mg/kg) or D4 (L-745,870 and RBI-257, 0.63-2.5 mg/kg) antagonists, but were prevented by the preferential D2 blocker L-741,626 (near-full antagonism at 2.5 mg/kg). The present data do not support a major implication of either DA D3 or D4 receptors in the control of PE and YA in rats, but indicate a preponderant role of DA D2 receptors.\n",
      "Study objective: To assess the relationship between clinical endpoints for induction of anesthesia and the electroencephalographic (EEG) bispectral index (BIS) and effect-site concentration (C(E)) values when using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of either thiopental sodium or propofol, by hypothesizing that yawning may be a useful alternative to other commonly used clinical signs for determining loss of consciousness.\n",
      "Design: Randomized observational clinical study.\n",
      "Setting: Operating room of a university-based hospital.\n",
      "Patients: 60 healthy adult patients (aged 20-50 yrs) scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia.\n",
      "Interventions: During a TCI of propofol (n = 30) or thiopental (n = 30), clinical endpoints for loss of verbal responsiveness (LOV), loss-of-eyelash reflex (LOE), occurrence of yawning, and apnea were assessed at 15-second intervals. In addition, BIS and C(E) values were recorded at each of the endpoints.\n",
      "Measurements and main results: In both anesthetic groups, the sequence of occurrence of the clinical endpoints was similar, namely LOV, LOE, yawning, and, lastly, apnea. Compared with LOV and LOE, yawning was associated with lower BIS and higher C(E) values with both anesthetics. The frequency of yawning was higher with thiopental than propofol (83% vs. 63%, respectively). However, the frequency of apnea was higher with propofol than thiopental (77% vs. 53%, respectively).\n",
      "Conclusion: The correlation of the clinical endpoints with BIS and C(E) values was highest for LOV. Yawning was as unreliable as LOE for determining the onset of unconsciousness during induction of anesthesia. This clinical sign failed to be observed in 17% and 37% of patients induced with thiopental and propofol, respectively.\n",
      "Objective: To assess the long-term results of the nasal airflow-inducing maneuver in olfaction rehabilitation in patients who had undergone laryngectomy.\n",
      "Design: Prospective interventional study.\n",
      "Setting: University hospital.\n",
      "Patients: Twenty-four patients who had undergone laryngectomy (21 men and 3 women; mean age, 68 years) who received olfactory rehabilitation with the nasal airflow-inducing maneuver were reevaluated 6 and 12 months after primary treatment.\n",
      "Main outcome measure: Olfactory function was tested by means of a semistructured interview; the Questionnaire on Olfaction, Taste and Appetite; and the Scandinavian Odor-Identification Test. Quality of life was measured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 questionnaires. Patients were categorized as smellers or nonsmellers based on results of the Scandinavian Odor-Identification Test.\n",
      "Results: Before treatment, 10 of 24 patients (42%) were smellers and 14 (58%) were nonsmellers. At 6-month follow-up, 20 of 23 patients (87%) were smellers, whereas after 12 months, 21 of 24 patients (88%) were smellers. Long-term olfaction rehabilitation was achieved in 11 of 14 patients (79%) with anosmia, and 15 of all 24 patients (63%) could be classified as having normal olfactory capacity at the end of the study.\n",
      "Conclusion: The nasal airflow-inducing maneuver is a patient-friendly, inexpensive, and effective method for restoring the sense of smell in patients after laryngectomy, and the results persist in the long term.\n",
      "Yawning is thought to be a behavior regulated by the brainstem. Although excessive yawning has been reported in brainstem strokes, demyelination, and tumors, the cases presented here are the first reports of excessive yawning in patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I). The authors believe that brainstem compression at the craniocervical junction and ensuing edema were implicated in this curious symptomatology. They describe excessive yawning as a presenting feature of CM-I in 2 adolescent females. The presentation was acute in the first case and more chronic in the second. Both patients underwent foramen magnum decompression, which resulted in complete cessation of the excessive yawning.\n",
      "The effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (NAME) and N-mono-methyl-L-arginine (NMMA), inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase on penile erection and yawning induced by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) was studied in male rats. NAME (75-150 micrograms) and NMMA (250-500 micrograms), but not N-monomethyl-D-arginine (D-NMMA)(250-500 micrograms) prevented both responses in a dose-dependent manner when given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) 15 min before NMDA (50 ng). NMDA-induced penile erection and yawning was also prevented by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (200-400 micrograms i.c.v.), but not by the NO scavenger methemoglobin (50-100 micrograms i.c.v.). NAME (10-20 micrograms), but not Methylene blue or methemoglobin (10-20 micrograms), prevented NMDA-induced responses also when injected in the PVN 15 min before NMDA. The present results suggest that NMDA-induced penile erection and yawning is mediated by an increased NO synthesis in the PVN.\n",
      "This study was designed to analyze the effects of nicotine on yawning behavior and neurotrophin content in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of D2-receptor primed female adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were neonatally treated with quinpirole, a dopamine (DA) D2/D3 agonist, from postnatal day 1-21 (P1-21) and raised to P60 and administered nicotine tartarate (0.3 mg/kg free base) or saline twice daily for 14 days. One day after nicotine treatment had ceased, the number of yawns was recorded for 1 h in response to an acute injection of quinpirole (i.p., 100 microg/kg). Yawning is a D2-receptor mediated event. D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant increase in yawning in response to acute quinpirole compared with that of controls, but nicotine did not alleviate this effect. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus that was alleviated by adulthood nicotine treatment. Interestingly, nicotine treatment to controls produced a significant increase of NGF in the frontal cortex, but a significant decrease of both NGF and BDNF in the hippocampus and BDNF in the frontal cortex. The decreases shown in NGF and BDNF is contrary to past findings that have shown nicotine to produce significant increases of hippocampal NGF and BDNF, but these past studies utilized male rats or mice or were performed in vitro. This study shows that nicotine has complex interactions with NGF and BDNF in D2-primed and control animals, and emphasizes the importance of gender differences when analyzing nicotine's effects on neurotrophins.\n"

      "Considerable neurochemical evidence links dopamine (DA) in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) to male sexual behavior. The present experiments were conducted to extend this information to the male's sexual response to remote stimuli from estrous female (noncontact erection; NCE). Male rats were tested for copulation and NCE after either 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or radiofrequency (RF) lesions in NAcc). Males with an average 78% depletion of DA in NAcc had a lower incidence of NCE, longer latency to display NCE, and fewer erections. DA-depleted males also had less locomotor activity after injections of d-amphetamine, and reductions in apomorphine-induced yawning, but a normal incidence of penile erection. Males with RF lesions of the NAcc had longer NCE latencies. All males copulated to ejaculation after either 6-OHDA or RF lesions with little or no deficit, although the 6-OHDA-treated males had longer intromission latencies. The NCE deficit supports the hypothesized role of NAcc DA in arousal processes in responding to remote cues from estrous females. The minimal effect of lesions on copulation suggests that the presence of additional proximal stimulation during copulation may overcome the deficits induced by DA depletions or lesions in NAcc.\n",
      "Background and purpose: The beneficial effect of 5-HT6 receptor antagonism in cognition remains controversial. This study has been undertaken to reassess the cognition enhancing properties of acute vs subchronic treatment with the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 in unimpaired rats, as well as against scopolamine (cholinergic-) or MK-801 (glutamatergic-mediated) deficits.\n",
      "Experimental approach: The Morris water maze was used, measuring behaviour acquisition and retention, and swim speed. Other behavioural measures included yawning and motor activity. SB-271046 was given acutely before each trial or subchronically for 7 days before the trials. The AChE inhibitor galanthamine was also used alone or in combination with SB-271046.\n",
      "Key results: Subchronic treatment with SB-271046 improved acquisition in the Morris water maze, while the acute treatment only improved retention. Neither acute nor subchronic SB-271046 treatment reversed scopolamine-induced learning deficits. MK-801 induced learning impairment associated with a behavioural syndrome, reversed by acute, but not subchronic, SB-271046 treatment. Interestingly, combined treatment with galanthamine and SB-271046 reversed the scopolamine- or MK-801-induced learning impairments. Subchronic treatment with SB-271046 did not modify motor activity or the increased number of yawns, a cholinergic-mediated behaviour, induced by single administration of SB-271046.\n",
      "Conclusions and implications: These data suggest a potential therapeutic role of 5-HT6 receptor antagonists such as SB-271046, alone or in combination with galanthamine, in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, such as those seen in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.\n",
      "Definite treatment of any pathological condition, is based on the understanding of its correct pathogenesis and etiology. Without this basic understanding correct and lasting treatment is not possible. When there is no knowledge of exact pathogenesis and etiology, various theories and treatments are suggested by various workers. This is what exactly happened in the case of habitual dislocations of the T.M. Joints. This in term has happened because the dental surgeons and so called oral surgeons, never expanded their vision, beyond their restricted field of 20 deciduous teeth and 32 permanent teeth. Lack of understanding of basic physiological functions, of various tissues in the body and their effects on various systems as a whole was neglected. For this study four patients were selected from many, who could visit my clinic regularly and co-operate to follow all the instructions over a period of at least 5 years. The analysis of their symptoms and signs, had a different story to tell than what was described in the literature so far.\n",

      "Background: Yawning is considered to be a symptom that reflects dopaminergic activity, although its pathophysiological mechanism is not yet fully understood. Interestingly, repetitive yawning is seen in some patients during migraine attacks. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the frequency of yawning during migraine attacks and its association with different characteristics of migraine.\n",
      "Methods: Patients with migraine with or without aura were evaluated using questionnaires and diaries to determine the characteristics of headache and accompanying symptoms. Repetitive yawning in the premonitory phase and/or during headache were determined.\n",
      "Results: Three hundred and thirty-nine patients were included in the study. One hundred and fifty-four patients reported repetitive yawning (45.4%) during migraine attacks. Repetitive yawning was reported in the 11.2% of the patients in the premonitory phase, 24.2% during headaches, and 10% both in the premonitory phase and during headaches. Migraine with aura (46.8 vs 31.9%; P = .005), accompanying nausea (89.6 vs 75.1%; P = .001), vomiting (48.7 vs 37.8%; P = .044), osmophobia (66.7 vs 52.3%; P = .024), and cutaneous allodynia (58.2 vs 46%; P = .032) were more common in patients with yawning than without. Other dopaminergic-hypothalamic premonitory symptoms (41.6 vs 26.5%; P = .003), especially sleepiness (17.5 vs 5.9%; P = .001), irritability/anxiety (21.4% vs 11.4%; P = .019), nausea/vomiting (10.4 vs 4.3%; P = .03), and changes in appetite (18.2 vs 9.7%; P = .024), were also more frequent in patients with yawning than without. After being adjusted for all other relevant covariates, the odds of repetitive yawning were increased by the presence of nausea (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.453-5.726; P = .002) and migraine with aura (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.035-2.671; P = .036).\n",
      "Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that yawning is a common self-reported symptom leading or accompanying migraine attacks and is associated with aura, nausea and/or vomiting, osmophobia, and cutaneous allodynia in patients with migraine. Although yawning is a rather frequently seen behavior, it is a unique and reliable symptom in patients with migraine that may offer an opportunity for early treatment of migraine attacks.\n",
      "One major mechanism underlying the central action of neurotensin is an interaction with the function of dopamine (DA)-containing neurons. In addition, direct or indirect DA agonists have been reported to promote neurotensin release. We have found that SR 48692, a non-peptide neurotensin receptor antagonist (0.04-0.64 mg/kg orally), antagonizes (50-65%) yawning induced by apomorphine (0.07 mg/kg SC) or bromocriptine (2 mg/kg IP) in rats, and turning behaviour induced by intrastriatal injection of apomorphine (0.25 micrograms), (+) SKF 38393 (0.1 micrograms), bromocriptine (0.01 ng) or (+) amphetamine (10 micrograms) in mice. Other apomorphine-induced effects in mice and rats such as climbing, hypothermia, hypo- and hyper-locomotion, penile erections and stereotypies were not significantly modified by SR 48692. Taken together, these data suggest that neurotensin may play a permissive role in the expression of some but not all behavioural responses to DA receptor stimulation.\n",
      "Diet can impact sensitivity of rats to some of the behavioral effects of drugs acting on dopamine systems. The current study tested whether continuous access to sucrose is necessary to increase yawning induced by the dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole, or if intermittent access is sufficient. These studies also tested whether sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning increases in rats drinking the non-caloric sweetener saccharin. Dose-response curves (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg) for quinpirole-induced yawning were determined once weekly in rats with free access to standard chow and either continuous access to water, 10% sucrose solution, or 0.1% saccharin solution, or intermittent access to sucrose or saccharin (i.e., 2 days per week with access to water on other days). Cumulative doses of quinpirole increased then decreased yawning, resulting in an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. Continuous or intermittent access to sucrose enhanced sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning. Continuous, but not intermittent, access to saccharin also enhanced sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning. In all groups, pretreatment with the selective D3 receptor antagonist PG01037 shifted the ascending limb of the quinpirole dose-response curve to the right, while pretreatment with the selective D2 receptor antagonist L-741,626 shifted the descending limb to the right. These results suggest that even intermittent consumption of diets containing highly palatable substances (e.g. sucrose) alters sensitivity to drugs acting on dopamine systems in a manner that could be important in vulnerability to abuse drugs.\n"

      "The effect of morphine on the increase of NO2- and NO3- concentration in the dialysate obtained with a microdialysis probe implanted in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and penile erection and yawning induced by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) was studied in male rats. NMDA (50 ng) injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, induced penile erection and yawning and increased NO2- from 1.10 +/- 0.28 microM to 7.30 +/- 1.10 microM and NO3- from 5.05 +/- 0.71 microM to 11.03 +/- 1.61 microM. Morphine (1-10 microg), but not U-69,593 (10 microg), a selective agonist of the kappa opiate receptor subtype, prevented in a dose-dependent manner NMDA-induced increase in NO2- and NO3- concentration when injected in the paraventricular nucleus 15 min before NMDA. Morphine prevention of NMDA-induced NO2- and NO3- increase was related to a concomitant decrease in the number of penile erection and yawning episodes induced by the excitatory amino acid. Morphine effect was not observed in male rats treated with the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (10 microg) microinjected in the paraventricular nucleus 15 min before morphine. The present results suggest that morphine prevents an NMDA-induced increase in paraventricular NO production, penile erection, and yawning by inhibiting NO synthase activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus through the stimulation of opioid receptors of the micro subtype.\n",
      "Emotions are often encountered in a multimodal fashion. Consequently, contextual framing by other modalities can alter the way that an emotional facial expression is perceived and lead to emotional conflict. Whole brain fMRI data was collected when 35 healthy subjects judged emotional expressions in faces while concurrently being exposed to emotional (scream, laughter) or neutral (yawning) sounds. The behavioral results showed that subjects rated fearful and neutral faces as being more fearful when accompanied by screams than compared to yawns (and laughs for fearful faces). Moreover, the imaging data revealed that incongruence of emotional valence between faces and sounds led to increased activation in the middle cingulate cortex, right superior frontal cortex, right supplementary motor area as well as the right temporoparietal junction. Against expectations no incongruence effects could be found in the amygdala. Further analyses revealed that, independent of emotional valence congruency, the left amygdala was consistently activated when the information from both modalities was emotional. If a neutral stimulus was present in one modality and emotional in the other, activation in the left amygdala was significantly attenuated. These results indicate that incongruence of emotional valence in audiovisual integration activates a cingulate-fronto-parietal network involved in conflict monitoring and resolution. Furthermore in audiovisual pairing amygdala responses seem to signal also the absence of any neutral feature rather than only the presence of an emotionally charged one.\n",
      "Ethanol abuse in pregnancy is known to produce serious damage to the developing central nervous system of mammalian species. As with several other classes of nerves, the ontogenetic influence of ethanol on dopamine (DA) nerves is long-lived. To test whether reactivity of DA receptors might be altered by prenatal ethanol administration, rats were given 10% (v/v) ethanol in their drinking water, starting 10 days before mating and continuing to the end of pregnancy. Male offspring were tested at 3 months for behavioral effects known to be induced by DA agonists acting at specific subtypes of DA receptors. The oral activity dose-effect curve for SKF 38393, a DA D1 agonist, was not altered from control. However, quinpirole-induced yawning behavior, reputedly a DA D3-associated event, was markedly impaired in the male rats that had been exposed in utero to ethanol. These findings indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure may predominately produce diminished reactivity of the DA D3, but not DA D1 subtype of DA receptor.\n",
      "The authors compared the pain intensity and difficulty experienced in performing activities of daily living (ADL) among 237 patients with orofacial pain. The patients underwent comprehensive examinations and recorded their subjective symptoms on a form (five items for pain intensity and six for ADL-related difficulty). On the basis of the primary diagnosis, the patients were divided into the temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ), myofascial pain (MP), neuropathic pain (NP), and fibromyalgia (FM) groups. The intensity of pain in the jaw/face, tightness in the jaw/face, pain in the neck, and toothache significantly differed among the groups (p < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test). Compared to other patients, the FM and NP groups reported greater pain intensity, whereas those in the TMJ group reported lesser pain intensity. The ADL-related difficulty was not significantly different among the groups. Thus, compared to pain due to joint-related disorders, myalgic and neuropathic pain seem to be of higher intensity.\n",
      "In awake dogs, voluntary deep inspiration results in a marked, reflex-mediated increase in coronary blood flow. To study this reflex in humans, we subselectively measured coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV) with a 3-F coronary Doppler catheter in 12 subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries. In each subject, intracoronary papaverine increased CBFV to 4.8 +/- 0.2 X resting CBFV and reduced coronary resistance to 0.20 +/- 0.01 X resting coronary resistance, demonstrating normal vasodilator reserve in the vessel under study. Valsalva maneuver reduced CBFV to 0.67 +/- 0.09 X resting CBFV and increased coronary resistance to 1.37 +/- 0.20 X resting coronary resistance (P less than 0.05 vs. control). Maximum voluntary inspiration, however, did not significantly change CBFV (peak response 1.03 +/- 0.05 X resting CBFV) or coronary resistance (0.96 +/- 0.04 X resting). To determine whether augmentation of resting alpha-adrenergic tone would potentiate the reflex, eight patients performed a sustained 33% maximal handgrip for 2 min. Maximal deep inspiration during handgrip failed to result in any significant change in CBFV or coronary resistance. These studies demonstrate that the canine pulmonary inflation reflex has little or no physiological significance in the coronary circulation of conscious humans. Additionally, these data suggest that the magnitude of reflex control of the coronary circulation may vary considerably between dogs and humans.\n",
      "Yawning is often observed not only in a state of boredom or drowsiness but also in stressful emotional situations, suggesting that yawning is an emotional behavior. However, the neural mechanisms for yawning during stressful emotional situations have not been fully determined, though previous studies have suggested that both parvocellular oxytocin (OT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are responsible for induction of yawning. Thus, using ethological observations and c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we examined whether emotional stress evoked by classical fear conditioning is involved in induction of yawning behavior in freely moving rats. Emotional stress induced yawning behavior that was accompanied by anxiety-related behavior, and caused neuronal activation of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), as well as increases in activity of both OT and CRF neurons in the PVN. These results suggest that emotional stress may induce yawning behavior, in which the neuronal activation of the CeA may have a key role.\n",
      "Food restriction enhances sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of a variety of drugs of abuse including opiates, nicotine, and psychostimulants. Food restriction has also been shown to alter a variety of behavioral and pharmacological responses to dopaminergic agonists, including an increased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulatory effects of direct- and indirect-dopamine agonists, elevated extracellular dopamine levels in responses to psychostimulants, as well as suppression of agonist-induced yawning. Behavioral and molecular studies suggest that augmented dopaminergic responses observed in food-restricted animals result from a sensitization of the dopamine D2 receptor; however, little is known about how food restriction affects dopamine D3 receptor function. The current studies were aimed at better defining the effects of food restriction on D2 and D3 receptor function by assessing the capacity of N'-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole-2,6-diamine dihydrochloride (pramipexole) to induce yawning, penile erection (PE), hypothermia, and locomotor activity in free-fed and food-restricted rats. Food restriction resulted in a suppression of pramipexole-induced yawning, a sensitized hypothermic response, and an enhanced locomotor response to pramipexole, effects that are suggestive of an enhanced D2 receptor activity; no effect on pramipexole-induced PE was observed. Antagonist studies further supported a food restriction-induced enhancement of the D2 receptor activity because the D2 antagonist 3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl]methyl-1H-indole (L741,626) recovered pramipexole-induced yawning to free-fed levels, whereas yawning and PE were suppressed following pretreatment with the D3 antagonist N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide hydrochloride (PG01037). The results of the current studies suggest that food restriction sensitized rats to the D2-mediated effects of pramipexole while having no effect on the D3-mediated effects of pramipexole.\n"

      "Intracerebroventricular (ICV) or PVN local injections of oxytocin induce yawning and penile erection, for which a positive feedback mechanism for the PVN oxytocinergic activation is suggested, but this had not been directly substantiated in vivo. We have assessed the behavioral effects and activity of oxytocinergic neurons with double-staining for c-Fos and oxytocin in the PVN after ICV administration of oxytocin in adult male rats. ICV oxytocin injections (50 and 200 ng) dose-dependently induced yawning and penile erection and significantly increased the percentage of c-Fos positive oxytocin neurons in the medial, dorsal and lateral parvocellular subdivision of the PVN. However, increases in the magnocellular portion were not significant. We also found that lithium chloride (LiCl, 0.5 and l.0 mEq), a compound known to activate oxytocinergic neurons, also significantly increased the percentage of c-Fos positive oxytocin neurons in all PVN portions. However, LiCl did not induce yawning and penile erection, but counteracted the oxytocin-induced yawning and penile erection. These results suggest that if the activation of oxytocinergic neurons in the PVN is important for mediating oxytocin-induced yawning and penile erection, a selective activation of parvocellular oxytocinergic neurons in the PVN is likely to be involved.\n",
      "The effect of morphine administered systemically or into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) on penile erection and yawning induced either by oxytocin or by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine was studied in male rats. Systemic morphine (0.5 to 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally [IP]) prevented in a dose-dependent manner penile erection and yawning induced by the intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) of oxytocin (30 ng) or by the subcutaneous (SC) administration of apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg). Morphine (0.1 to 5 micrograms), but not U-69,593 (5 micrograms), injected into the PVN 10 minutes before oxytocin or apomorphine, was found to be able to prevent penile erection and yawning induced by the unilateral PVN microinjection of oxytocin (10 ng) or apomorphine (50 ng). The morphine-induced prevention of these behavioral responses was abolished by pretreatment with naloxone (3 mg/kg IP) 15 minutes before morphine. The present results suggest that morphine prevents apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning by inhibiting the activity of oxytocinergic neurons through mu-type receptors in this hypothalamic nucleus.\n",
      "The high co-morbidity of eating disorders and substance abuse suggests that nutritional status can impact vulnerability to drug abuse. These studies used rats to examine the effects of food restriction on dopamine clearance in striatum and on the behavioral effects of amphetamine (locomotion, conditioned place preference), the dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole (yawning), and the dopamine receptor antagonist raclopride (catalepsy). Amphetamine increased locomotion and produced conditioned place preference. Food restriction reduced dopamine clearance, which was restored by repeated treatment with amphetamine or by free feeding. Food restriction also decreased sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning and raclopride-induced catalepsy; normal sensitivity to both drugs was restored by free feeding. The same amphetamine treatment that normalized dopamine clearance, failed to restore normal sensitivity to quinpirole or raclopride, suggesting that in food-restricted rats the activity of dopamine transporters and dopamine receptors is differentially affected by pathways that are stimulated by amphetamine. These studies show that modest changes in nutritional status markedly alter dopamine neurotransmission and the behavioral effects of direct-acting dopamine receptor drugs (agonist and antagonist). These results underscore the potential importance of nutritional status (e.g., glucose and insulin) in modulating dopamine neurotransmission and in so doing they begin to establish a neurochemical link between the high co-morbidity of eating disorders and drug abuse.\n",
      "A dose of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA, 50 ng) that induces penile erection and yawning when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, increased the concentration of NO2- from 1.10 +/- 0.28 microM to 7.32 +/- 1.12 microM and of NO3 from 4.96 +/- 0.69 microM to 10.5 +/- 1.61 microM in the paraventricular dialysate obtained from male rats by in vivo microdialysis. NO2- concentration was not increased by (+/-)-alpha-(amino)-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA, 100 ng) or by trans-(+/-)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD) (100 ng), which were unable to induce these behavioral responses. N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid effect on NO2- concentration, penile erection and yawning was prevented by dizolcipine (MK-801) (10-100 ng) or by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (20 microg), but not by the oxytocin receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)2,Orn8]vasotocin (100 ng), or by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (20 microg) given in the paraventricular nucleus 15 min before N-methyl-D-aspartic acid or by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally 30 min before N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. In contrast, the nitric oxide scavenger hemoglobin (20 microg) given in the paraventricular nucleus prevented N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced NO2- concentration increase, but was unable to prevent penile erection and yawning. The results suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid induces penile erection and yawning by increasing nitric oxide synthase activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, possibly in the cell bodies of oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extra-hypothalamic brain areas and mediating these behavioral responses.\n",
      "Schizophrenia may reflect a sensitization of dopaminergic (DA) function. Apomorphine (Apo), a DA receptor agonist, induces both sensitization and tolerance of DA function in rodents depending on dose intervals. We investigated sensitization and tolerance to Apo in healthy male volunteers. After a period of acclimatization to the experimental setting (Day 1) subjects were assigned randomly to two groups: Group A subjects received seven injections of placebo (physiological saline) (PLA) and Group B subjects received seven injections of Apo HCl (7 microg/kg sc) under double-blind conditions at 2 h intervals commencing at 0930 hours (Day 2) after an overnight fast. Twelve hours after the seventh injection, i.e. on Day 3, after an overnight fast all subjects received an injection of Apo. Serial samples of blood commencing at 0900 hours were drawn after the first and last injection in both groups for assay of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and cortisol by radioimmunoassay; sleepiness was measured using the Analog Sleepiness Rating Scale and yawning recorded by video recorder. The GH response in Group B (N = 8) was (a) decreased after the eighth injection of Apo compared with the first injection of Apo (P = 0.03) and (b) decreased after the eighth injection of Apo compared with the first injection of Apo in Group A (N = 10) (P = 0.001). The number of yawns in Group B was significantly decreased after the eighth injection of Apo compared with the first injection of Apo (P = 0.042). PRL, cortisol and sleepiness were not significantly different between the first and eighth injection of Apo. Sensitization was not observed in any of the measures studied. These results are compatible with induction of acute tolerance of DA-mediated GH and yawning responses. The method used provides a safe pharmacological paradigm to examine plasticity of DA mechanisms in man. Results are discussed in the context of possible therapeutic implications for schizophrenia.\n",

      "This study investigated the clinical temporomandibular disorders (TMD), pain-related disability and psychological status of TMD patients using a computerized on-line TMD diagnostic system (NUS TMD v1.1). A total of 107 patients (32 male, 75 female) referred to the TMD clinics at the National Dental Centre and National University Hospital participated in this study. The mean age of the predominantly Chinese population (82.2%) was 30.8 years (range from 12 to 64 years). The history questionnaire and clinical examination were input directly into computers by patients and clinicians. A 'Summary of Findings' was then immediately generated by the program based on Axis I and II rules. The data was subsequently exported to SPSS for statistical analysis. About 20.6% of the patients had myofascial pain but only 7.5% experienced limited mandibular opening associated with myofascial pain. The majority of patients (> 80%) did not suffer from disc displacements (right and left joints). The frequency of arthralgia was also low (right joint 8.4%; left joint 7.5%) and only one patient had osteoarthosis of the TMJ. About 78.5% of the patients had low disability with almost equal distribution between low and high intensity pain, 27.1% of the patients were moderately depressed and 11.2% had severe depression. No significant difference in limitations related mandibular functioning scores was observed between normal/depressed patients and between patients with the different graded chronic pain severity classification. The three most frequent jaw disabilities were: eating hard foods (77.6%), yawning (75.7%) and chewing (64.5%). NUS TMD v1.1 is an extremely useful tool in the diagnosis/research of clinical TMD.\n"

      "Oxytocin (5-100ng), but not Arg8-vasopressin (100ng), injected unilaterally into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) induces penile erection and yawning in a dose-dependent manner in male rats. The minimal effective dose was 20ng for penile erection and 5ng for yawning. Oxytocin responses were abolished not only by the oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2-Orn8-vasotocin (1μg), but also by (+) MK-801 (1μg), an excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) subtype, SCH 23390 (1μg), a D1 receptor antagonist, but not haloperidol (1μg), a D2 receptor antagonist, and SMTC (40μg), an inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, injected into the BNST 15min before oxytocin. Oxytocin-induced penile erection, but not yawning, was also abolished by CNQX (1μg), an excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist of the AMPA subtype. In contrast, oxytocin responses were not reduced by bicuculline (20ng), a GABAA receptor antagonist, phaclofen (5μg), a GABAB receptor antagonist, CP 376395, a CRF receptor-1 antagonist (5μg), or astressin 2B, a CRF receptor-2 antagonist (150ng). Considering the ability of NMDA (100ng) to induce penile erection and yawning when injected into the BNST and the available evidence showing possible interaction among oxytocin, glutamic acid, and dopamine in the BNST, oxytocin possibly activates glutamatergic neurotransmission in the BNST. This in turn leads to the activation of neural pathways projecting back to the paraventricular nucleus, medial preoptic area, ventral tegmental area, and/or ventral subiculum/amygdala, thereby inducing penile erection and yawning.\n",
      "Purpose: We evaluated the erectogenic properties of a new cyclic alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue, Melanotan-II, to treat men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction.\n",
      "Materials and methods: Ten men with erectile dysfunction of no known organic cause were entered in a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study in which the erectogenic properties of Melanotan-II and a vehicle placebo were compared using real-time RigiScan monitoring. The presence, duration and rigidity of erections were recorded during a 6-hour period.\n",
      "Results: In 8 of 10 men treated with Melanotan-II clinically apparent erections developed. Mean duration of tip rigidity greater than 80% was 38.0 minutes with Melanotan-II and 3.0 with placebo (p=0.0045). Transient side effects of nausea, stretching and yawning, and decreased appetite were reported more frequently after injections of Melanotan-II than placebo but none required treatment.\n",
      "Conclusions: Melanotan-II is a potent initiator of erections in men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction and has manageable side effects at a dose of 0.025 mg./kg.\n",
      "The effect of excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists, (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5, 10-imine hydrogen maleate ((+)-MK-801), (+/-)-3-(2-carboxy-piperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and (+/-)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (AP-4), on penile erection and yawning induced by subcutaneous apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg), intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) oxytocin (30 ng) and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-(1-24) (10 micrograms) was studied in male rats. Intraperitoneal (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) and i.c.v. (10-50 micrograms) (+)-MK-801 prevented dose dependently the penile erection and yawning induced by the three drugs. The (+)-MK-801 effect coincided with the appearance of head weaving, body rolling, hyperlocomotion and ataxia. Haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) antagonized the prevention by (+)-MK-801 of oxytocin responses. Penile erection but not yawning was also prevented by high, but not low doses of CPP and CNQX, which impaired motor performance, AP-4 was ineffective at all doses tested. The above compounds were ineffective when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the brain area where apomorphine and oxytocin act to induce penile erection and yawning. The results suggest that excitatory amino acid transmission is not involved in the expression of penile erection and yawning induced by the above compounds.\n",
      "Background: Migraine is frequently associated with nonheadache symptoms before, during, and after the headache. Premonitory symptoms occurring before the attack have not been rigorously studied. Should these symptoms accurately predict headache, there are considerable implications for the pathophysiology and management of migraine.\n",
      "Methods: Electronic diaries were used in a 3-month multicenter study to record nonheadache symptoms before, during, and after migraine. The authors recruited subjects who reported nonheadache symptoms in at least two of three attacks that they believed predicted headache. Symptoms were entered in the diaries by patient initiation and through prompted entries at random times daily. Entries could not be altered retrospectively. Data recorded included nonheadache symptoms occurring during all three phases of the migraine, prediction of the attack from premonitory symptoms, general state of health, and action taken to prevent the headache.\n",
      "Results: One hundred twenty patients were recruited: 97 provided usable data. Patients correctly predicted migraine headaches from 72% of diary entries with premonitory symptoms. A range of cognitive and physical symptoms was reported at a similar rate through all three phases of the migraine. The most common premonitory symptoms were feeling tired and weary (72% of attacks with warning features), having difficulty concentrating (51%), and a stiff neck (50%). Subjects who functioned poorly in the premonitory phase were the most likely to correctly predict headache.\n",
      "Conclusions: Using an electronic diary system, the authors show that migraineurs who report premonitory symptoms can accurately predict the full-blown headache.\n",
      "An important number of Sprague-Dawley males selected by strict inbreeding process for their high spontaneous yawing frequency (HY) fail to copulate after repeated exposure to receptive females. These HY males that fail to mate are called non-copulators (HYNC). The causes of this behavioral deficit are still unknown. The aim of the present study was to make a detailed behavioral characterization of these animals by evaluating: their partner preference between a sexually receptive female as opposed to a sexually active male; their ability to detect food related odors and their preference for sexually relevant chemosensory cues between bedding from estrous females, bedding from sexually active males and clean bedding. We also evaluated whether these males had alterations in motor function using a rotarod or in their general reward system mediated by opioids by injecting them with 1mg/kg of morphine to evaluate if they develop conditioned place preference (CPP). At the end of these behavioral tests, we measured their plasmatic levels of testosterone (T). Together, these results will contribute to elucidate the causes of their deficient copulatory performance. Both HYNC and HY copulators (HYC) males showed a clear preference for receptive females as opposed to sexually active males. As well, both groups of animals had a similar ability to detect food related odors. HYC males had a clear preference for estrous female odors as opposed to male or clean bedding, but HYNC males spend the same amount of time sniffing estrous, anestrous, male and clean bedding. In both, HYC and HYNC, morphine induced CPP suggesting that in these males the reward system is functional. No differences were found in motor coordination or in T levels between HY and HYNC males. The behavioral deficit in HYNC male rats cannot be explained by an alteration in: partner preference, food related odor recognition, motor coordination, general reward system, or differences in plasmatic levels of T. However, HYNC males present clear deficits in recognizing sexually relevant odors. These results could, at least in part, explain the deficient execution of copulatory pattern in HYNC males.\n",
      "The present experiments were performed to investigate effects of (+/-)-2-(dipropylamino)-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (7-OH-DPAT) or quinpirole (LY 171555), putative dopamine (DA) D3 receptor agonists, on serum prolactin levels in male rats. Basal prolactin levels were reduced dose-dependently by SC administration of 7-OH-DPAT or quinpirole at respective doses of 10-100 micrograms/kg and 25-250 micrograms/kg. Daily treatment with estradiol, 35 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days, increased serum prolactin levels to fourfold higher levels than those of nonprimed rats. Intraperitoneal injection of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT), 300 mg/kg, also increased serum prolactin levels. 7-OH-DPAT or quinpirole at a dose of 50 micrograms/kg caused a marked reduction in serum prolactin levels in both the estradiol- and alpha-MT-induced hyperprolactinemia. The 7-OH-DPAT- and quinpirole-induced decreases in serum prolactin levels were antagonized by the administration of the DA D2 receptor antagonist, spiperone, at 0.5 mg/kg. The results indicate that 7-OH-DPAT and quinpirole decrease prolactin levels in rats by stimulation of the D2 receptor.\n"

      "Of the various conservative treatment modalities available for temporomandibular disorders, we believe that therapeutic exercise has a good prognosis, especially for anterior disc displacement without reduction. Since its effectiveness has not been extensively evaluated, we conducted a comparative study to verify the hypothesis that treatment efficacy would not differ for exercise and occlusal splints. Fifty-two individuals with anterior disc displacement without reduction were randomly assigned to a splint or a joint mobilization self-exercise treatment group. Four outcome variables were evaluated: (i) maximum mouth-opening range without and (ii) with pain, (iii) current maximum daily pain intensity, and (iv) limitation of daily functions. All outcome variables significantly improved after 8 weeks of treatment in both groups. In particular, the mouth opening range increased more in the exercise group than in the splint group. This result demonstrates that therapeutic exercise brings earlier recovery of jaw function compared with splints.\n",
      "The effect of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), (+-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), or (+-)-trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclo-pentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD) (5-60 ng in 0.3 microliter of saline) microinjected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus on penile erection and yawning was studied in male rats. NMDA induced both penile erection and yawning in a dose-dependent manner. AMPA and ACPD also induced penile erection but less potently than NMDA, but were ineffective in causing yawning. NMDA effect on penile erection and yawning was prevented by (+)-MK-801 (0.05-0.1 mg/kg IP, 10 min before NMDA), by the oxytocin antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8- vasotocin (50-100 ng ICV 10 min before NMDA), but not by haloperidol (0.1-0.5 mg/kg IP 10 min before NMDA). The results suggest that NMDA induces penile erection and yawning by increasing oxytocinergic transmission by acting in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n",
      "Cocaine abuse and obesity are serious public health problems, and studies suggest that both dopamine and serotonin systems are involved in regulating the consumption of drugs and food. Lorcaserin has serotonin (5-HT)2C receptor agonist actions, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating obesity, and might be effective for treating cocaine abuse. These studies characterized the pharmacokinetic and behavioral profiles of lorcaserin (intragastric administration) and determined the effectiveness of lorcaserin to alter discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects of cocaine (intravenous administration) in rhesus monkeys. Administered acutely, lorcaserin dose-dependently increased the occurrence of yawning while decreasing spontaneous activity and operant responding for food. These effects appeared within 30-60 minutes of administration and began to dissipate by 240 minutes, a time course closely matching plasma concentrations of lorcaserin. In monkeys discriminating cocaine from saline, lorcaserin alone did not occasion cocaine-appropriate responding but shifted the cocaine dose-response curve to the right and down in two of three monkeys. When administered acutely, lorcaserin dose-dependently decreased the rate at which monkeys responded for infusions of cocaine. When administered chronically, 3.2 mg/kg lorcaserin reduced the rate of cocaine-maintained responding by 50% for the duration of a 14-day treatment period. Together, these results show that lorcaserin attenuates the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine after acute administration and the reinforcing effects of cocaine after acute and repeated administration, consistent with the view that it might have utility in treating cocaine abuse.\n",
      "Previously, we showed that intranigrostriatal injection of substance P (SP) cause behavioral changes in rats. Those effects, such as locomotion and food intake, resulted related to catecholamines release modulated by nitric oxide [18]. Here we report that intranigrostriatal injection of SP elicited yawning in rats. Moreover, since in previous studies we demonstrated that transglutaminase-synthesized gamma-(glutamyl5)spermine derivative of SP (Spm-SP) could be a useful tool in differentiating NK1 receptors [5,19,26], we reports the effects of injecting the selective septide-sensitive NK1 receptor agonist Spm-SP into the nigrostriatal region of the rat brain on yawning. The administration of L-N(omega)-nitroarginine methyl ester, a NO-synthase inhibitor, stereospecifically reduced in a dose related manner both SP and Spm-SP-induced yawning. In contrast, L-arginine pretreatment prevented the effect of NO-synthase inhibitor. Moreover, the NK1 antagonist RP,67580 blocked yawning behavior induced by both SP and Spm-SP, whereas the pretreatment with systemic reserpine determined its increase. The administration of NO-synthase inhibitor resulted ineffective in reducing SP and Spm-SP-induced yawns in reserpinized rats. Finally, yawns elicited by SP or Spm-SP were blocked when rats were treated with scopolamine but not with methylscopolamine. These results indicate that yawning induced in rats by SP injection is dependent upon endogenous dopamine levels in brain nigrostriatal area. Moreover, we demonstrate, by using Spm-SP, that septide-sensitive NK1 receptor are specifically involved in yawning behavior.\n",

      "Dopamine D(2)-like agonists induce penile erection (PE) and yawning in a variety of species, effects that have been suggested recently to be specifically mediated by the D(4) and D(3) receptors, respectively. The current studies were aimed at characterizing a series of D(2), D(3), and D(4) agonists with respect to their capacity to induce PE and yawning in the rat and the proerectile effects of apomorphine [(R)-(-)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-6-methyl-4H-dibenzo-[de,g]quinoline-10,11-diol hydrochloride] in wild-type and D(4) receptor (R) knockout (KO) mice. All D(3) agonists induced dose-dependent increases in PE and yawning over a similar range of doses, whereas significant increases in PE or yawning were not observed with any of the D(4) agonists. Likewise, D(2), D(3), and D(4) antagonists were assessed for their capacity to alter apomorphine- and pramipexole (N'-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole-2,6-diamine dihydrochloride)-induced PE and yawning. The D(3) antagonist, PG01037 [N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide hydrochloride], inhibited the induction of PE and yawning, whereas the D(2) antagonist, L-741,626 [3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl]methyl-1H-indole], reversed the inhibition of PE and yawning observed at higher doses. The D(4) antagonist, L-745,870 [3-(4-[4-chlorophenyl]piperazin-1-yl)-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine trihydrochloride], did not alter apomorphine- or pramipexole-induced PE or yawning. A role for the D(3) receptor was further supported because apomorphine was equipotent at inducing PE in wild-type and D(4)RKO mice, effects that were inhibited by the D(3) antagonist, PG01037, in both wild-type and D(4)R KO mice. Together, these studies provide strong support that D(2)-like agonist-induced PE and yawning are differentially mediated by the D(3) (induction) and D(2) (inhibition) receptors. These studies fail to support a role for the D(4) receptor in the regulation of PE or yawning by D(2)-like agonists.\n",
      "The effects of chronic administration of antidepressant drugs (21-22 days s.c. via osmotic mini-pumps) on the behavioural responses of male Sprague-Dawley rats to (-)-quinpirole hydrochloride (0.05 mg kg-1 s.c., 5 min) and (+/-)-SKF 38393 hydrochloride (10 mg kg-1 s.c., 5 min) were investigated. Desipramine hydrochloride (10 mg kg-1 per day), phenelzine sulphate (10 mg kg-1 per day) and clorgyline hydrochloride (1 mg kg-1 per day) attenuated the suppression of locomotor activity induced by quinpirole, a dopamine D2-like receptor agonist, while clomipramine hydrochloride (10 mg kg-1 per day) was without effect. Yawning elicited by quinpirole was absent in phenelzine- and clorgyline-treated rats, but unaffected in rats treated chronically with desipramine and clomipramine. SKF 38393, a dopamine D1-like receptor agonist, significantly increased locomotor activity and time spent grooming in control animals. There were no significant effects of antidepressants on the behavioural responses to SKF 38393.\n"

      "Background: The premonitory stage of migraine attacks, when symptomatology outside of pain can manifest hours to days before the onset of the headache, is well recognised. Such symptoms have been reported in adults in a number of studies, and have value in predicting an impending headache. These symptoms have not been extensively studied in children. We aimed to characterise which, if any, of these symptoms are reported in children seen within a Specialist Headache Service.\n",
      "Methods: We reviewed clinic letters from the initial consultation of children and adolescents seen within the Specialist Headache Service at Great Ormond Street Hospital between 1999 and 2015 with migraine in whom we had prospectively assessed clinical phenotype data. We randomly selected 100 cases with at least one premonitory symptom recorded in the letter. For these patients, the age at headache onset, presence of family history of headache, headache diagnosis, presence of episodic syndromes which may be associated with headache, developmental milestones, gestation at birth, mode of delivery and presence of premonitory symptoms occurring before or during headache were recorded.\n",
      "Results: Of the 100 patients selected, 65 % were female. The age range of the patients was 18 months to 15 years at the time of headache onset. The most common diagnosis was chronic migraine in 58 %, followed by episodic migraine (29 %), New Daily Persistent Headache with migrainous features (8 %) and hemiplegic migraine (5 %). A history of infantile colic was noted in 31 % and was the most common childhood episodic syndrome associated with migraine. The most common premonitory symptoms recorded were fatigue, mood change and neck stiffness. The commonest number of reported premonitory symptoms was two.\n",
      "Conclusion: Premonitory symptoms associated with migraine are reported in children as young as 18 months, with an overall clinical phenotype comparable to adults. Better documentation of this stage will aid parents and clinicians to better understand the phenotype of attacks, better recognise migraine and thus initiate appropriate management. Larger studies with a broader base are warranted to understand the extent and implications of these symptoms for childhood and adolescent migraine.\n",
      "This study analysed the relationship between complaints and mandibular function after closed treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle in a prospective study. In a 1-year follow-up, complaints were assessed during physical examination and function was assessed using the mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ), scoring range 0-68. Data from 114 patients (41 women, 73 men), mean age 28.1 years (SD 13.3), were available. On average the MFIQ scores were low 3.4 (SD 7.3). Ten patients (9%) experienced pain and 45 (39%) patients had a MFIQ score > 0. Mean mouth opening was 51.9 mm (SD 8.4). Occlusion was perceived as moderate or poor by 24% of the patients. In the logistic regression analysis mandibular function impairment (MFIQ score > 0) was entered as a dependent variable. Risk factors for mandibular function impairment were: pain, perceived occlusion (moderate or poor), absolute difference between left and right horizontal movements and age. A protective factor was mouth opening. The results of this study show that complaints (i.e. pain, perceived occlusion, reduced mouth opening, difference between left and right lateral movements and increased age) are predictors of mandibular function impairment after closed treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle.\n",
      "The N-n-propyl analog of dihydrexidine ((+/-)-trans-10, 11-dihydroxy-5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridine) is a dopamine receptor agonist with high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (K0.5 = 26 and 5 nM, respectively). Members of the hexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridine structural class are atypical because they display high intrinsic activity at post-synaptic dopamine D2 receptors, but low intrinsic activity at dopamine D2 autoreceptors. The present study examined the effects of (+/-)-N-n-propyl-dihydrexidine on unconditioned behaviors in rats. The most striking results observed were large, dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity (e.g., locomotor inhibition), and increases in vacuous chewing; yawning was also increased at the highest dose of (+/-)-N-n-propyl-dihydrexidine. The locomotor inhibition and yawning induced by (+/-)-N-n-propyl-dihydrexidine were blocked by pre-treatment with (-)-remoxipride (S(-)-3-bromo-N-((1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-methyl)-2, 6-dimethoxybenzamide), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, but not by the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist (+)-SCH23390 (R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1 H-3-benzazepine). Vacuous chewing was decreased by both (-)-remoxipride and (+)-SCH23390. These data support the hypothesis that a subpopulation of post-synaptic dopamine D2 receptors has a critical role in decreases in locomotor activity and induction of vacuous chewing and yawning.\n",
      "Although dopamine D(3) receptors have been associated with cocaine abuse, little is known about the consequences of chronic cocaine on functional activity of D(3) receptor-preferring compounds. This study examined the behavioral effects of D(3) receptor-selective 4-phenylpiperazines with differing in vitro functional profiles in adult male rhesus monkeys with a history of cocaine self-administration and controls. In vitro assays found that PG 619 (N-(3-hydroxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-(pyridin-2-yl)benzamide HCl) was a potent D(3) antagonist in the mitogenesis assay, but a fully efficacious agonist in the adenylyl cyclase assay, NGB 2904 (N-(4-(4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-9H-fluorene-2-carboxamide HCl) was a selective D(3) antagonist, whereas CJB 090 (N-(4-(4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-(pyridin-2-yl)benzamide HCl) exhibited a partial agonist profile in both in vitro assays. In behavioral studies, the D(3) preferential agonist quinpirole (0.03-1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently elicited yawns in both groups of monkeys. PG 619 and CJB 090 elicited yawns only in monkeys with an extensive history of cocaine, whereas NGB 2904 did not elicit yawns, but did antagonize quinpirole and PG 619-elicited yawning in cocaine-history monkeys. In another experiment, doses of PG 619 that elicited yawns did not alter response rates in monkeys self-administering cocaine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg per injection). Following saline extinction, cocaine (0.1 mg/kg) and quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg), but not PG 619 (0.1 mg/kg), reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior. When given before a cocaine prime, PG 619 decreased cocaine-elicited reinstatement. These findings suggest that (1) an incongruence between in vitro and in vivo assays, and (2) a history of cocaine self-administration can affect in vivo efficacy of D(3) receptor-preferring compounds PG 619 and CJB 090, which appear to be dependent on the behavioral assay.\n",

      "Sexual dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) since brain dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of sexual behavior. Activation of dopamine D2 receptor sites, with resultant release of oxytocin from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, induces sexual arousal and erectile responses in experimental animals and humans. In Parkinsonian patients subcutaneous administration of apomorphine, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, induces sexual arousal and penile erections. It has been suggested that the therapeutic efficacy of transcranial administration of AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla flux density in PD involves the activation of dopamine D2 receptor sites which are the principal site of action of dopaminergic pharmacotherapy in PD. Here, 1 report 2 elderly male PD patients who experienced sexual dysfunction which was recalcitrant to treatment with anti Parkinsonian agents including selegiline, levodopa and tolcapone. However, brief transcranial administrations of AC pulsed EMFs in the picotesla flux density induced in these patients sexual arousal and spontaneous nocturnal erections. These findings support the notion that central activation of dopamine D2 receptor sites is associated with the therapeutic efficacy of AC pulsed EMFs in PD. In addition, since the right hemisphere is dominant for sexual activity, partly because of a dopaminergic bias of this hemisphere, these findings suggest that right hemispheric activation in response to administration of AC pulsed EMFs was associated in these patient with improved sexual functions.\n"

      "Among the various reported neuropsychological effects of electroconvulsive therapy are amnesia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, headaches, and seizures. A case history is presented that describes a previously unreported neurological sequela: the development of intractable yawning during a course of electroconvulsive therapy. Neuropathophysiological mechanisms possibly relating to this phenomenon are discussed.\n",
      "A retrospective study of 96 cases of temporomandibular joint dislocation was undertaken. Patients' ages ranged from 9 to 85 years (mean+/-SD, 35.3+/-17.4 years) and peak incidence was at 20-29 years. Mean duration was 7.9 weeks (range, 1h to 3 years). Acute, chronic and recurrent dislocations were seen in 46 (47.9%), 29 (30.2%) and 21 (21.9%) patients, respectively. Males dominated in all three categories but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.8). Excessive mouth opening while yawning (44 cases) was the commonest cause of dislocation, followed by road traffic accidents (13 cases). Ten patients (10.4%) had an underlying systemic disease, the commonest being epilepsy (four cases); those with acute dislocation recorded the highest incidence of underlying illness. Bilateral anterior (86 cases) dislocations were the most frequent. Of the 96 patients, 89 (92.7%) were available for treatment. Manual reduction with or without anaesthesia proved effective for 38/45 acute, 5/24 chronic and 14/20 recurrent cases. Chronic dislocations were treated mainly by surgical osteotomy (13/24). Vertical subsigmoid and oblique ramus osteotomies were the commonest surgical techniques recorded. Treatment was satisfactory for all patients surgically handled except for one case of anterior open bite postoperatively. This study has shown that excessive mouth opening while yawning is the commonest cause of temporomandibular joint dislocation in Nigerians, and conservative approaches to management remain quite effective irrespective of the duration and clinical subtype. The best choice of surgical technique should be determined by proper clinical evaluation and the need to avoid or minimize postoperative morbidity.\n",
      "The long term complications of radiotherapy in treating patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are well recognized. Among these, neurological and endocrinological complications are usually considered to be more clinically important. On the other hand, postirradiation sinusitis is often neglected or overlooked because symptoms are usually non-specific or not clinically disturbing. This leads to the under-reporting of this complication. We report the case history of a patient with NPC who developed recurrent and debilitating bouts of yawning attacks 13 years after radiotherapy. The attacks were thought to be due to the compression of the hypothalamus by a large mucocoele in the sphenoidal sinus, which was successfully managed by surgical drainage.\n",
      "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of oral glucosamine sulfate, compared with placebo, on osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joints (TMJs).\n",
      "Study design: Fifty-nine patients, consecutive referrals fulfilling the research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorder for TMJ osteoarthritis, confirmed roentgenographically, were randomized to the daily intake of 1,200 mg glucosamine sulfate or identical placebo capsules in this double-blind trial. Pain on visual and verbal rating scales and opening capacity were registered before and after 6 weeks of medication.\n",
      "Results: The signs and symptoms were similar in the groups initially and they were ameliorated over time. No differences in improvement between groups after treatment were indicated. Eight patients in the glucosamine group and 2 in the placebo group stopped the medication prematurely. Gastrointestinal side effects were reported by a total of 10 and 3 patients, respectively.\n",
      "Conclusions: Oral glucosamine sulfate was not superior to placebo in reducing signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis in the TMJs in this short-term trial.\n",
      "Collectively, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and adjacent C1 neurons regulate breathing, circulation and the state of vigilance, but previous methods to manipulate the activity of these neurons have been insufficiently selective to parse out their relative roles. We hypothesize that RTN and C1 neurons regulate distinct aspects of breathing (e.g., frequency, amplitude, active expiration, sighing) and differ in their ability to produce arousal from sleep. Here we use optogenetics and a combination of viral vectors in adult male and female Th-Cre rats to transduce selectively RTN (Phox2b+ /Nmb +) or C1 neurons (Phox2b+/Th +) with Channelrhodopsin-2. RTN photostimulation modestly increased the probability of arousal. RTN stimulation robustly increased breathing frequency and amplitude; it also triggered strong active expiration but not sighs. Consistent with these responses, RTN innervates the entire pontomedullary respiratory network, including expiratory premotor neurons in the caudal ventral respiratory group, but RTN has very limited projections to brainstem regions that regulate arousal (locus ceruleus, CGRP+ parabrachial neurons). C1 neuron stimulation produced robust arousals and similar increases in breathing frequency and amplitude compared with RTN stimulation, but sighs were elicited and active expiration was absent. Unlike RTN, C1 neurons innervate the locus ceruleus, CGRP+ processes within the parabrachial complex, and lack projections to caudal ventral respiratory group. In sum, stimulating C1 or RTN activates breathing robustly, but only RTN neuron stimulation produces active expiration, consistent with their role as central respiratory chemoreceptors. Conversely, C1 stimulation strongly stimulates ascending arousal systems and sighs, consistent with their postulated role in acute stress responses.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The C1 neurons and the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) reside in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Both regulate breathing and the cardiovascular system but in ways that are unclear because of technical limitations (anesthesia, nonselective neuronal actuators). Using optogenetics in unanesthetized rats, we found that selective stimulation of either RTN or C1 neurons activates breathing. However, only RTN triggers active expiration, presumably because RTN, unlike C1, has direct excitatory projections to abdominal premotor neurons. The arousal potential of the C1 neurons is far greater than that of the RTN, however, consistent with C1's projections to brainstem wake-promoting structures. In short, C1 neurons orchestrate cardiorespiratory and arousal responses to somatic stresses, whereas RTN selectively controls lung ventilation and arterial Pco2 stability.\n",
      "Objective: To observe the prevalence and characteristics of premonitory symptoms in Chinese migraineurs and explore their associations with migraine-related factors.\n",
      "Method: Migraineurs who visited a tertiary headache clinic and one of nine neurology clinics between May 2014 and November 2019 were studied.\n",
      "Result: Among the 4821 patients meeting the migraine criteria (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition), 1038 (21.5%) patients experienced at least one premonitory symptom. The most common premonitory symptoms were neck stiffness, dizziness, yawning and drowsiness. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that aura, photophobia, aggravation by routine physical activity, triggers, family history, depression, coffee consumption and physical exercise were associated with an increased probability of experiencing premonitory symptoms (p ≤ 0.001). The premonitory symptoms of migraine with and without aura differ in prevalence and most common symptoms. The cluster analysis revealed pairwise clustering of the following premonitory symptoms: Photophobia/phonophobia, concentration change/dysesthesia, loquacity/overactivity, yawning/drowsiness, fatigue/dizziness, and mood change/irritability. The correlation analysis of triggers and premonitory symptoms revealed that temperature change, environment change, sleep disorder, activity and stress were related to multiple premonitory symptoms, and that food, light, menstruation, alcohol and odor were related to special premonitory symptoms (p ≤ 0.001).\n",
      "Conclusion: The prevalence of premonitory symptoms among migraineurs in China is 21.5%. Some factors influence the probability of experiencing premonitory symptoms. Paired premonitory symptoms in the clustering analysis may share similar origins. Certain triggers associated with multiple premonitory symptoms may induce brain dysfunction; however, other triggers that overlap with corresponding special premonitory symptoms may be premonitory symptoms or a form of premonitory symptom.\n"

      "A series of compounds structurally related to pramipexole were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as ligands for the dopamine 3 (D3) receptor. Compound 12 has a K(i) value of 0.41 nM to D3 and a selectivity of >30000- and 800-fold over the D1-like and D2 receptors, respectively.

      "It is well known that the corpus striatum is related to the sterotyped activation induced by several psychostimulants. In this study we analyzed the effects of 6-OHDA, in comparison with those of ibotenic acid lesions, into the dorsal striatum, on the behavioural pattern induced by saline or D-amphetamine treatment. A computerized technique for recording the animal motor activity was developed in order to define in a detailed way the behavioural profile in lesioned and sham-operated rats induced by the saline or D-amphetamine treatment. A 6-OHDA lesion into the dorsal striatum modified the basal behavioural pattern which was mainly characterized by reduced motor activation while ibotenic acid lesion affected the structure of the basal behavioral pattern. D-Amphetamine administration in 6-OHDA lesioned rats induced a behavioural stimulation, but a decreased motor and stereotyped activation was observed compared to the sham-operated animals treated with D-amphetamine. In contrast, D-amphetamine administration in the ibotenic acid-lesioned rats induced a motor and stereotyped activity which was not reduced compared to that seen after D-amphetamine treatment in sham-operated rats. These results suggest that these two types of lesion induced differential effects on the behavioural pattern either after saline or after D-amphetamine administration. Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum plays a permissive role on the emergence of the behavioural responses, while the dorsal striatum circuitry plays a crucial role on the organization of the behavioural pattern. In addition, dopaminergic activity in this structure serves a primary control in the D-amphetamine-elicited motor activation or stereotypy, while the striatal structure is involved in the shaping of the D-amphetamine behavioural pattern.\n",
      "According to published data, peptide neurotensin is considered as endogenous antipsychotic agent. A series of oligopeptides have been synthesized based on the proposed active center of neurotensin. These oligopeptides (called neurotensin-like peptides, NLPs) have been studied on behavioral models, in which the functional state of the dopamine system of animals was modified by apomorphine injections. The results of verticalization, stereotypy, and yawning tests revealed NLPs that behave as antagonists of dopamine receptors. Radioligand analysis showed that these peptides compete for specific binding to these receptors with sulpiride, which is a D2-type selective antagonist of dopamine receptors. The high degree of NLPs efficiency manifested in the behavioral tests and radioligand analysis suggests that the their antipsychotic action can be mediated by dopamine receptors.\n",
      "Prolactin blood level and apomorphine-induced yawning were studied in rats treated with the substituted benzamide amisulpride in association with bromocriptine or carmoxirole; two dopamine D(2) receptor agonists with high or low propensity to cross the brain-blood barrier, respectively. Administration of amisulpride produced a maximum increase in rat serum prolactin level (315+/-18%) vs. vehicle-treated animals (ED(50)=0.25+/-0.017 mg/kg, s.c.). The concurrent administration of carmoxirole or bromocriptine completely reversed the hyperprolactinemia induced by amisulpride (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) (ID(50)=14.9+/-0.8 mg/kg and 0.81+/-0.03 mg/kg, respectively). Carmoxirole (15 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect yawning induced by apomorphine (0.08 mg/kg, s.c.) nor amisulpride (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) blockade of apomorphine-induced yawning. Conversely, a significant increase in the number of yawns was observed when bromocriptine (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) was associated with apomorphine in the absence or presence of amisulpride. These results suggested that a peripheral dopamine D(2) receptor agonists could be a useful tool in alleviating amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinemia without possibly affecting its central effect.\n",
      "Objective: We set out to compare the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine versus venlafaxine in patients with undifferentiated somatoform disorder (USD) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15).\n",
      "Methods: This was a 12-week prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial. The trial consisted of six visits that included baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. The primary effectiveness measure was the mean change in PHQ-15 total score from baseline to the end of treatment. Secondary effectiveness measures included the mean changes in total scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) from baseline to the end of treatment. Ninety-five subjects were randomized to either mirtazapine (n = 50) or venlafaxine (n = 45); 71 subjects completed the study (mirtazapine: n = 39/50 [78%]; venlafaxine: n = 32/45 [71%]).\n",
      "Results: The mean total score on the PHQ-15 decreased by 34.7% (-8.4, p < 0.0001) from baseline to endpoint in the mirtazapine group and by 26.6% (-6.1, p < 0.0001) in the venlafaxine group. A marginally significant between-group difference was observed for the mean change in total score on the PHQ-15 from baseline to endpoint (F = 4.126, p = 0.046). The mean total scores on the GHQ-12 and BDI from baseline to endpoint decreased by -4.9 (29.4%, p < 0.0001) and -13.5 (55.9%, p < 0.0001), respectively, in the mirtazapine group, and by -4.3 (26.2%, p = 0.001) and -9.02 (46.0%, p < 0.0001), respectively, in the venlafaxine group. No between-group difference was observed for the mean changes in total scores on the secondary effectiveness measures from baseline to endpoint. Both treatments were well tolerated.\n",
      "Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both mirtazapine and venlafaxine may be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with USD. Double-blind, placebo-controlled and/or head-to-head comparison studies are required to allow definite conclusions to be drawn.\n",
      "Yawning, frequent in daily life, is accepted as a complex arousal reflex. Excessive yawning may be due to neurological, psychiatric, infectious, gastrointestinal or metabolic diseases. This reflex has also been associated with different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. We report a female patient, with excessive yawning, who was on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment with the diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder. She was then found to have endometrial carcinoma. Her complaints of palpitation, shortness of breath and loss of energy might be explained by a psychiatric disease and/or anaemia. Previous anaemic periods and partial response of her psychiatric symptoms during last 3 years alerted us to think about an organic cause. Investigations for chronic disease anaemia resulted in diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. This case is a good example showing misdiagnosis caused by medical stigmatisation.\n",
      "Migraine attacks are often preceded by premonitory symptoms. Prevalence rates of migraine patients reporting one or more premonitory symptoms show considerable variability and rates range between 12% and 79%. Sources of variability might be differences in study population or research design. Using a questionnaire, we retrospectively studied the prevalence of 12 predefined premonitory symptoms in a clinic-based population. Of 461 migraine patients, 374 (81%) responded. At least one premonitory symptom was reported by 86.9% and 71.1% reported two or more. The most frequently reported premonitory symptoms were fatigue (46.5%), phonophobia (36.4%) and yawning (35.8%). The mean number of premonitory symptoms per person was 3.2 (+/- 2.5). Women reported 3.3 premonitory symptoms compared with 2.5 symptoms in men (P = 0.01). Age, education, migraine subtype (with or without aura) and mean attack frequency had no effect on the mean number of symptoms per individual. In conclusion, premonitory symptoms are frequently reported by migraine patients. Sensitivity and specificity of premonitory symptoms for migraine need to be assessed using prospective methods.\n"

      "To determine the effect of prenatal lead exposure on brain monoaminergic systems, pregnant rats were given tap water containing 250 ppm lead acetate, for the duration of pregnancy, while tap water without lead (Pb(2+)) was substituted at birth. Control rats were derived from dams that consumed tap water during pregnancy, and had no exposure to lead afterwards. At 12 weeks after birth, Pb(2+) content of brain cortex was increased 3- to 4-fold (P < 0.05). At this time the endogenous striatal levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid were 19% lower in Pb(2+) exposed rats (P < 0.05), while there was no change in the striatal level of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HPLC/ED). Also there was no change in these monoamines and metabolites in the prefrontal cortex of Pb(2+) exposed rats. However, turnover of 5-HT in prefrontal cortex, as indicated by 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation 30 min after acute treatment with the decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg IP), was lower in the Pb(2+) exposed rats. In the striatum AMPH-induced (1 mg/kg IP) turnover of DA, evidenced as L-DOPA accumulation after NSD-1015, was increased to a lesser extent in the Pb(2+) exposed rats (P < 0.05). The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (10 mg/kg IP) attenuated the latter effect, indicating that neuronal NO mediates this AMPH effect, at least in part. Moreover, DA D(2) receptor sensitivity developed in Pb(2+) exposed rats, as evidenced by enhanced quinpirole-induced yawning activity and enhanced quinpirole-induced locomotor activity (each, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that ontogenetic exposure to lead can have consequences on monoaminergic neuronal function at an adult stage of life, generally promoting accentuated behavioral effects of direct and indirect monoaminergic agonists, and related to increased dopamine turnover in basal ganglia.\n",
      "Background: Dopaminergic symptoms may be extremely pronounced in some migraine patients during the attack, representing a major source of disability.\n",
      "Objectives: We aimed to carefully characterize the clinical picture of migraine patients with dopaminergic symptoms in a large patients' population as a putative migraine endophenotype, allowing more precise disease management, treatment and outcome prediction.\n",
      "Methods: We screened 1148 consecutive tertiary care episodic and chronic migraine patients with face-to-face interviews collecting thorough data on lifestyle, socio-demographic factors, and clinical migraine features.\n",
      "Results: We identified 374 patients with migraine with dopaminergic symptoms (32.6%). The most frequent dopaminergic symptom was yawning followed by somnolence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, mood changes and diuresis.

      "Self-injurious behavior (SIB) presents a serious problem in laboratory macaques that cannot be socially housed for scientific reasons and among institutionalized children and adults where it is often associated with different forms of brain dysfunction. We have experienced limited success in reducing SIB in macaques by enhancing their environment with enrichment devices. Psychotropic drugs also help, but problems are associated with their use. Because sexual and aggressive behavioral problems in men have been treated with progestational drugs, we tested the efficacy of cyproterone acetate (CA, 5-10 mg/kg/week) on reducing SIB in 8 singly housed, adult male rhesus macaques. The main findings were: (1) SIB and other atypical behaviors were significantly reduced during CA treatment; (2) serum testosterone was significantly reduced during CA treatment; (3) cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of 5HIAA and HVA, metabolites of serotonin and dopamine, respectively, declined significantly during CA treatment; (4) the duration of SIB positively correlated with levels of 5HIAA in CSF; but (5) sperm counts were not reduced during treatment. Thus, CA was a partially effective treatment (3 months) for adult male macaques whose behavioral problems include SIB. In summary, CA reduced SIB, overall aggression, serum testosterone, CSF 5HIAA, and CSF HVA. We hypothesized that the progestin activity of CA represses the hypothalamic gonadal axis and decreases testosterone, which in turn decreases SIB. In addition, we speculate that the decrease in 5HIAA and HVA in CSF may have been caused by progestins decreasing the activity of MAO. Therefore, the reduction of SIB may also be related to an increase in the availability of active monoamines in the CNS.\n"

      "Increases in dopamine D(2) receptor sensitivity are known to be common in drug abuse and neurological disorders. Past data from this laboratory have shown that long-term increases in D(2) sensitivity can be produced by quinpirole treatment (a D(2)/D(3) agonist) during early development. The present investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that nicotine administration in adulthood would reduce both cognitive and skilled reaching impairments produced by increases in D(2) sensitivity. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline from postnatal day 1 (PD 1) to PD 21. Beginning in adulthood (PD 61), rats were treated with nicotine (0.3 mg/kg free base) or saline twice daily for 14 consecutive days before behavioural testing commenced. Animals neonatally treated with quinpirole demonstrated performance deficits on the Morris water task and a skilled reaching task compared to controls. Deficits on both tasks were completely alleviated by adulthood nicotine treatment. Animals neonatally treated with quinpirole demonstrated a significant 36% decrease of ChAT in the hippocampus compared to saline controls that was partially eliminated by nicotine. Additionally, neonatal quinpirole produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF content compared to controls, however, nicotine failed to alleviate this decrease in NGF. The results of this investigation demonstrate that long-term increases in dopamine D(2) receptor sensitivity produce significant decreases in hippocampal cholinergic and NGF expression that may result in cognitive impairment. Nicotine alleviates both cognitive and skilled reaching impairments caused by increases in D(2) sensitivity, but the mechanism through which nicotine is acting is currently unknown.\n",

      "Results: High-dose daidzein (100 mg/kg) decreased erectile responses to apomorphine from the 30th day of daidzein treatment and lasted to the 90th day without significant differences compared with the diethylstilbestrol-treated rats. However, similar changes were observed in the medium-dose daidzein (20 mg/kg) group from the 60th day. Low-dose daidzein (2 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the erectile responses to apomorphine compared with the normal control group (P >0.05). The plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels showed a declining trend similar to that of the apomorphine-induced erections.\n",
      "Conclusions: The phytoestrogen daidzein has the potential to adversely affect erectile function in a dose and time-related manner that is at least partly attributable to androgen deficiency. These findings implicate that phytoestrogens, especially isoflavones, if overconsumed for a long period, might be a novel risk factor for erectile dysfunction.\n",

      "Objective: In Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg (GAERSs), epileptogenesis takes place during brain maturation and correlates with increased mRNA expression of D3 dopamine receptors (D3R). Whether these alterations are the consequence of seizure repetition or contribute to the development of epilepsy remains to be clarified. Here, we addressed the involvement of the dopaminergic system in epilepsy onset in GAERSs.\n",
      "Methods: Experiments were performed using rats at different stages of brain maturation from three strains according to their increasing propensity to develop absence seizures: nonepileptic control rats (NECs), Wistar Hannover rats, and GAERSs. Changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission were investigated using different behavioral and neurochemical approaches: autoradiography of D3R and dopamine transporter, single photon emission computed tomographic imaging, acute and chronic drug effects on seizure recordings (dopaminergic agonists and antagonists), quinpirole-induced yawns and dopamine synaptosomal uptake, microdialysis, brain tissue monoamines, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor quantification.\n",
      "Results: Autoradiography revealed an increased expression of D3R in 14-day-old GAERSs, before absence seizure onset, that persists in adulthood, as compared to age-matched NECs. This was confirmed by increased yawns, a marker of D3R activity, and increased seizures when animals were injected with quinpirole at low doses to activate D3R. We also observed a concomitant increase in the expression and activity of the dopamine transporter in GAERSs before seizure onset, consistent with both lowered dopamine basal level and increased phasic responses.\n",
      "Significance: Our data show that the dopaminergic system is persistently altered in GAERSs, which may contribute not only to behavioral comorbidities but also as an etiopathogenic factor in the development of epilepsy. The data suggest that an imbalanced dopaminergic tone may contribute to absence epilepsy development and seizure onset, as its reversion by a chronic treatment with a dopamine stabilizer significantly suppressed epileptogenesis. Our data suggest a potential new target for antiepileptic therapies and/or improvement of quality of life of epileptic patients.\n",
      "The possible involvement of nitric oxide in the prevention by morphine of apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning was investigated by measuring the concentration of NO2- and NO3- in the dialysate obtained with a vertical microdialysis probe implanted in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of male rats. Either apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg s.c.) or oxytocin (30 ng i.c.v.) increased significantly basal NO2- and NO3- concentration in the paraventricular dialysate, penile erection and yawning. Morphine (1.5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) prevented dose-dependently either apomorphine or oxytocin responses when given 15 min before apomorphine or oxytocin. Prevention by morphine of apomorphine and oxytocin responses was abolished by naloxone (3 mg/kg i.p.) given 15 min before morphine. Morphine prevented apomorphine and oxytocin responses also when given in the lateral ventricles or directly in the paraventricular nucleus. In contrast, the selective agonist of the kappa opioid receptor subtype U-69,593 was found to be ineffective. The present results confirm previous findings showing that morphine acts through mu receptors in the paraventricular nucleus to prevent apomorphine and oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning and suggest that this morphine effect is mediated by a decreased activity of nitric oxide in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n"

      "Aims: To determine if retrospective self-report of oral parafunctional behaviors potentially relevant to pain conditions is valid, by comparing oral parafunctional behaviors via a self-report instrument (Oral Behaviors Checklist [OBC]) with in-field reports of oral parafunction.\n",
      "Methods: Individuals with a range of oral parafunctional behaviors, as identified by the OBC, were recruited, and 22 completed the field study. Using the Ecological Momentary Assessment paradigm, each subject was randomly prompted about eight times per day, for a target of 7 days, via portable handheld computer to report current behaviors among 11 queried items. Before and after the field study, a paper version of the OBC was administered. Separately, 74 individuals participated in a test-retest study of the paper OBC. Analyses included regression, correlation, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and area under the receiving operating curve (AUC).\n",
      "Results: Pre- and postfield study administration of the OBC exhibited substantial reliability (ICC = 0.65), indicating no reactivity during the intervening in-field data collection. Reliability across in-field days was low, indicating high variability in which behavior occurred on which day. Nonobservable behaviors were reported more frequently than observable behaviors. Self-report via OBC was linear with in-field data collection methods (R2 values ranged from 0.1 to 0.7; most values were within 0.3 to 0.4). The predictive value of the self-report total score was AUC (0.88) relative to the in-field study score. Separate test-retest reliability of the OBC was almost perfect (ICC = 0.88).\n",

      "Rats were made tolerant to morphine by subcutaneous implantation of morphine alkaloid pellets. Three days after pellet implantation, withdrawal was induced by pellet removal and was assessed 6 h later. Immediately prior to withdrawal assessment, rats were injected with dynorphin A-(1-13) either i.th. (via a catheter), i.c.v. (via a cannula) or i.v. (via the tail vein). When administered i.th. in the dose range 1.25-5 nmol/rat, dynorphin A-(1-13) attenuated withdrawal over the 40 min observation period. Similarly, dynorphin A-(1-13) administered i.v. (37.5-150 nmol/kg) attenuated withdrawal, though only over the first 20 min following administration. Dynorphin A-(1-13) up to 10 nmol/rat had no effect on withdrawal scores. These data indicate that dynorphin acts at spinal sites to suppress withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats and may play a role in tolerance and dependence mechanisms.\n",

      "Background: Premonitory symptoms are commonly reported in the adult migraine population; however, little information is available for the pediatric population.\n",
      "Methods: Data were collected on new patients being evaluated in our multidisciplinary pediatric headache clinic over a six-month time interval. The data collected from patients diagnosed with migraine were then reviewed for the following premonitory symptoms: yawning, neck stiffness, fatigue, increased urination, mood changes, and food cravings. History was obtained regarding the frequency of headaches and other associated behavioral or psychological problems.\n",
      "Results: A total of 176 patients were enrolled over a six-month interval, ranging in age from four to 18 years (mean age 12 years); 64% were female, and 42% (74 of 176) of the subjects had at least one premonitory symptom. Patients with migraine with aura were noted to have a significantly higher association with premonitory symptoms (59%, 30 of 51) (P < 0.05). Anxiety disorder was also significantly associated with premonitory symptoms (55%, 11 of 20) (P < 0.05). Fatigue and mood changes were the most commonly reported premonitory symptoms.\n",

There were no significant differences in premonitory symptoms by gender or age group (less than 12 years versus greater than 12 years). Anxiety and migraine with aura were correlated with an increased likelihood of premonitory symptoms.\n",

      "Contagious yawning differs from spontaneous yawning because it occurs when an individual yawns in response to someone else's yawn. In Homo sapiens and some non-human primates contagious yawning is higher between strongly than weakly bonded individuals. Up to date, it is still unclear whether this social asymmetry underlies emotional contagion (a basic form of empathy preferentially involving familiar individuals) as predicted by the Emotional Bias Hypothesis (EBH) or is linked to a top-down, selective visual attention bias (with selective attention being preferentially directed toward familiar faces) as predicted by the Attentional Bias Hypothesis (ABH). To verify whether the visual attentional bias explained the yawn contagion bias or not, in this study, we considered only yawns that could be heard but not seen by potential responders (auditory yawns). Around 294 of auditory yawning occurrences were extrapolated from over 2000 yawning bouts collected in free ranging humans for over nine years. Via GLMM, we tested the effect of intrinsic features (i.e., gender and age) and social bond (from strangers to family members) on yawn. The individual identity of the subjects (trigger and potential responder) was included as random factor. The social bond significantly predicted the occurrence of auditory yawn contagion, which was highest between friends and family members. A gender bias was also observed, with women responding most frequently to others' yawns and men being responded to most frequently by others. These results confirm that social bond is per se one of the main drivers of the differences in yawn contagion rates between individuals in support of the EBH of yawn contagion.\n",
      "Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent and pilocarpine, a cholinergic receptor agonist, produced yawning in rats, with the most effective doses being 0.25 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively. The yawning induced by these drugs is characterized by differences in direction of head moving, tongue protruding and duration of the yawn. The apomorphine-induced yawn was characterized by a slow and wide opening of the mouth with the head moving mainly downward and with a marked protrusion of the tongue. The apomorphine-induced yawn was 3.6 sec in duration. Physostigmine elicited a similar yawn to that seen with apomorphine, except for moving of the head in the upward direction. The pilocarpine-induced yawn was characterized by the head moving forward with a high frequency but without tongue protrusion and lasted 1.8 sec. The frequency of physiological yawning was low, but the behavioral posture was almost similar to that of physostigmine-induced yawning. The characteristics of yawns induced by these agents were unchanged at all doses of the drugs. Different doses altered the frequency of yawning. After pretreatment with mecamylamine, the apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced tongue protruding was inhibited and the duration of the yawning induced by the both drugs was shortened. The results suggest that the behavioral features of yawning induced by apomorphine, physostigmine and pilocarpine differ from one another, and that physiological yawning as well as physostigmine-induced yawning may be mediated by endogenous acetylcholine which stimulates both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.\n",
      "Recent evidence suggests that yawning is a thermoregulatory behavior. To explore this possibility further, the frequency of contagious yawning in humans was measured while outdoors in a desert climate in the United States during two distinct temperature ranges and seasons (winter: 22°C; early summer: 37°C). As predicted, the proportion of pedestrians who yawned in response to seeing pictures of people yawning differed significantly between the two conditions (winter: 45%; summer: 24%). Across conditions yawning occurred at lower ambient temperatures, and the tendency to yawn during each season was associated with the length of time spent outside prior to being tested. Participants were more likely to yawn in the milder climate after spending long periods of time outside, while prolonged exposure to ambient temperatures at or above body temperature was associated with reduced yawning. This is the first report to show that the incidence of yawning in humans is associated with seasonal climate variation, further demonstrating that yawn-induced contagion effects can be mediated by factors unrelated to individual social characteristics or cognitive development.\n"

      "Contagious yawning-the urge to yawn when thinking about, listening to, or viewing yawning-is a well-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. The reduced yawn contagion observed in the autistic population suggested that it might be empathy related; however, it is unknown whether such a connection applies to nonclinical populations. We examined influences from both empathy (i.e., autistic traits) and nonempathy factors (i.e., individuals' perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning, happy, and angry faces) on 41 nonclinical adults. We induced contagious yawning with a 5-minute video and 20 yawning photo stimuli. In addition, we measured participants' autistic traits (with the autism-spectrum quotient questionnaire), eye gaze patterns, and their perceptual thresholds to detect yawning and emotion in human face photos. We found two factors associated with yawning contagion: (a) those more sensitive to detect yawning, but not other emotional expressions, displayed more contagious yawning than those less sensitive to yawning expressions, and (b) female participants exhibited significantly more contagious yawning than male participants. We did not find an association between autistic trait and contagious yawning. Our study offers a working hypothesis for future studies, in that perceptual encoding of yawning interacts with susceptibility to contagious yawning.\n",
      "Accumulating comparative and interdisciplinary research supports a brain cooling function to yawning. In particular, previous research has shown significant decreases in both brain and skull temperature following yawning in mammals. In a recent study using a thermal imaging camera, significant reductions in both the cornea and concha temperature were observed following yawns in the high-yawning subline of Sprague-Dawley rats. Here, we performed a similar experiment to investigate shifts in facial temperature surrounding yawning in an avian species with more typical yawning patterns: budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). In particular, we took maximal surface temperature recordings from the face (cere or eye) from 13 birds over a one-hour period to track changes before and after yawns. Similar to previous findings in high-yawning rats, we identified significant cooling (-0.36°C) of the face 10-20 seconds following yawning in budgerigars. Consistent with the hypothesis that yawns serve a thermoregulatory function, facial temperatures were slightly elevated just prior to yawning and then decreased significantly below baseline levels immediately thereafter. Similarly, birds that yawned during the trials had consistently higher facial temperatures compared to those that did not yawn. Moreover, yawn latency and overall yawn frequency were strongly correlated with the highest facial temperature recorded from each bird across trials. These results provide convergent evidence in support of a brain cooling function to yawning, and further validate the use of thermal imaging to monitor changes in skull temperature surrounding yawning events.\n",
      "Both individuals with diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and individuals high in psychopathic traits show reduced susceptibility to contagious yawning; that is, yawning after seeing or hearing another person yawn. Yet it is unclear whether the same underlying processes (e.g., reduced eye gaze) are responsible for the relationship between reduced contagion and these very different types of clinical traits. College Students (n = 97) watched videos of individuals yawning or scratching (a form of contagion not reliant on eye gaze for transmission) while their eye movements were tracked. They completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), the Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R), and the Adolescent and Adult Sensory Processing Disorder Checklist. Both psychopathic traits and autistic traits showed an inverse relationship to contagious yawning, consistent with previous research. However, the relationship between autistic (but not psychopathic) traits and contagious yawning was moderated by eye gaze. Furthermore, participants high in autistic traits showed typical levels of contagious itching whereas adults high in psychopathic traits showed diminished itch contagion. Finally, only psychopathic traits were associated with lower overall levels of empathy. The findings imply that the underlying processes contributing to the disruptions in contagious yawning amongst individuals high in autistic vs. psychopathic traits are distinct. In contrast to adults high in psychopathic traits, diminished contagion may appear amongst people with high levels of autistic traits secondary to diminished attention to the faces of others, and in the absence of a background deficit in emotional empathy.\n",
      "While comparative research on contagious yawning has grown substantially in the past few years, both the interpersonal factors influencing this response and the sensory modalities involved in its activation in humans remain relatively unknown. Extending upon previous studies showing various in-group and status effects in non-human great apes, we performed an initial study to investigate how the political affiliation (Democrat vs. Republican) and status (high vs. low) of target stimuli influences auditory contagious yawning, as well as the urge to yawn, in humans. Self-report responses and a subset of video recordings were analyzed from 118 undergraduate students in the US following exposure to either breathing (control) or yawning (experimental) vocalizations paired with images of former US Presidents (high status) and their respective Cabinet Secretaries of Commerce (low status). The overall results validate the use of auditory stimuli to prompt yawn contagion, with greater response in the experimental than the control condition. There was also a negative effect of political status on self-reported yawning and the self-reported urge to yawn irrespective of the condition. In contrast, we found no evidence for a political affiliation bias in this response. These preliminary findings are discussed in terms of the existing comparative evidence, though we highlight limitations in the current investigation and we provide suggestions for future research in this area.\n",
      "Behavioral contagion is suggested to promote group coordination that may facilitate activity transitions, increased vigilance, and state matching. Apart from contagious yawning, however, very little attention has been given to this phenomenon, and studies on contagious yawning in primates have so far only focused on Old World monkeys and apes. Here we studied behavioral contagion in common marmosets, a species for which group coordination and vigilance are paramount. In particular, we investigated the contagiousness of yawning, stretching, scratching, tongue protrusion, gnawing, and scent-marking. We coded these behaviors from 14 adult marmosets, from two different social groups. During testing sessions, animals were separated into groups of four individuals for 20-min observation periods, across three distinct diurnal time points (morning, midday, and afternoon) to test for circadian patterns. We observed almost no yawning (0.12 yawns/h) and very little stretching behavior. For all other behaviors, which were more common, we found several temporal and inter-individual differences (i.e., sex, age, dominance status) predictive of these responses. Moreover, we found that gnawing and scent-marking, which almost always co-occurred as a fixed-action pattern, were highly temporally clustered within observation sessions. We discuss the relative absence of yawning in marmosets as well as the possible function of contagious scent-marking, and provide suggestions for future research into the proximate and ultimate functions of these behaviors in marmosets.\n",
      "An operant conditioning paradigm comprising continuous food-reinforcement, fixed-ratio responding, and extinction procedures was used to evaluate the possibility that adult male macaques can control their rate of yawning. Two non-food-deprived Macaca tonkeana quickly learned to produce yawns for food rewards. They also increased the rate of production according to fixed-ratio requirements, and showed initial response peaks followed by diminished rates of yawning during extinction. The results indicate that adult male macaques can yawn voluntarily. Further work along these lines may help distinguish among different types of yawning as indicated in the literature.\n"

      "Background: Yawning consistently poses a conundrum to the medical profession and neuroscientists. Despite neurological evidence such as parakinesia brachialis oscitans in stroke patients and thermo-irregulation in multiple sclerosis patients, there is considerable debate over the reasons for yawning with the mechanisms and hormonal pathways still not fully understood. Cortisol is implicated during yawning and may link many neurological disorders. Evidence was found in support of the Thompson cortisol hypothesis that proposes cortisol levels are elevated during yawning just as they tend to rise during stress and fatigue.\n",
      "Objectives: To investigate whether saliva cortisol levels rise during yawning and, therefore, support the Thompson cortisol hypothesis.\n",
      "Methods: We exposed 20 male and female volunteers aged between 18 and 53 years to conditions that provoked a yawning response in a randomized controlled trial. Saliva samples were collected at the start and again after the yawning response, or at the end of the stimuli presentations if the participant did not yawn. In addition, we collected electromyographic data of the jaw muscles to determine rest and yawning phases of neural activity. Yawning susceptibility scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, General Health Questionnaire, and demographic and health details were also collected from each participant. A comprehensive data set allowed comparison between yawners and nonyawners, as well as between rest and yawning phases. Collecting electromyographic data from the yawning phase is novel, and we hope this will provide new information about neuromuscular activity related to cortisol levels. Exclusion criteria included chronic fatigue, diabetes, fibromyalgia, heart conditions, high blood pressure, hormone replacement therapy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. We compared data between and within participants.\n",

      "Yawning is a stereotyped behavioral pattern characterized by wide opening of the mouth associated with deep inspiration followed by short expiration. All vertebrate species yawn, but with low frequencies. We obtained two sublines of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by a strict inbreeding process: one with a high-yawning frequency (HY) of 20 yawns/h, which is one order of magnitude higher with respect to the low-yawning frequency (LY) subline, with 2 yawns/h. Outbred SD rats had a yawning frequency of 1 yawn/h. HY dams had a different organization of maternal care with respect to that displayed by LY and SD dams because HY dams constructed lower quality nests and had more re-retrieving and atypical retrieving. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in maternal care using in- and cross-fostering between the sublines and SD dams and to measure spontaneous and dopaminergic-induced yawning, penile erections, grooming and scratching bouts. We also measured the expression of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum using Western blot analysis. Our results showed that HY male rats reared by SD or LY dams did not significantly differ in yawning frequencies with respect to HY male rats reared by mothers of their own phenotype. Maternal care did not differ between sublines and SD dams independent of the litter they reared. However, LY rats reared by HY dams showed a significant increase in the number of spontaneous penile erections. Importantly, in-fostered HY male rats had the highest number of yawns induced by systemic administration of (-)-quinpirole supporting that higher maternal care display can influence the frequency of dopaminergic-induced yawning. In fact HY male rats in all conditions yawned more than did LY and SD male rats independent of the dam that raised them supporting a strong influence of genetic background. However SD male rats raised by LY dams showed significantly increased the dopamine D2 receptor expression. In conclusion, maternal care and the environmental nest conditions during the lactation period did not change the phenotypic characteristics of the yawning sublines supporting that their genetic background is fundamental for the expression of spontaneous or dopaminergic-induced yawning.\n",
      "The ultimate function of yawning continues to be debated. Here, we examine physiological measurements taken before, during, and after yawns in humans, in an attempt to identify key proximate mechanisms associated with this behavior. In two separate studies we measured changes in heart rate, lung volume, eye closure, skin conductance, ear pulse, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and respiratory rate. Data were depicted from 75 s before and after yawns, and analyzed at baseline, during, and immediately following yawns. Increases in heart rate, lung volume, and eye muscle tension were observed during or immediately following yawning. Patterns of physiological changes during yawning were then compared to data from non-yawning deep inhalations. In one study, respiration period increased following the execution of a yawn. Much of the variance in physiology surrounding yawning was specific to the yawning event. This was not the case for deep inhalation. We consider our findings in light of various hypotheses about the function of yawning and conclude that they are most consistent with the brain cooling hypothesis.\n",
      "Laughter and yawning can both occur spontaneously and are highly contagious forms of social behavior. When occurring contagiously, laughter and yawning are usually confounded with a social situation and it is difficult to determine to which degree the social situation or stimulus itself contribute to its contagion. While contagious yawning can be reliably elicited in lab when no other individuals are present, such studies are more sparse for laughter. Moreover, laughter and yawning are multimodal stimuli with both an auditory and a visual component: laughter is primarily characterized as a stereotyped vocalization whereas yawning is a predominantly visual signal and it is not known to which degree the visual and auditory modalities affect the contagion of laughter and yawning. We investigated how these two sensory modalities contribute to the contagion of laughter and yawning under controlled laboratory conditions in the absence of a social situation that might confound their contagion. Subjects were presented with naturally produced laughter and yawning in three sensory modalities (audio, visual, audio-visual), and we recorded their reaction to these stimuli. Contagious responses differed for laughter and yawning: overall, laughter elicited more contagious responses than yawning, albeit mostly smiling rather than overt laughter. While the audio-visual condition elicited most contagious responses overall, laughter was more contagious in the auditory modality, and yawning was more contagious in the visual modality. Furthermore, laughter became decreasingly contagious over time, while yawning remained steadily contagious. We discuss these results based on the ontogenetic and phylogenetic trajectories of laughter and yawning.\n"

      "Yawning is a widely recognized behavior in mammalian species. One would expect that elephants yawn, although to our knowledge, no one has reported observations of yawning in any species of elephant. After confirming a behavioral pattern matching the criteria of yawning in two Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in a zoological setting, this study was pursued with nine captive African elephants (Loxodonta africana) at a private reserve in the Western Cape, South Africa, the Knysna Elephant Park. Observations were made in June-September and in December. In the daytime, handlers managed seven of the elephants for guided interactions with visitors. At night, all elephants were maintained in a large enclosure with six having limited outdoor access. With infrared illumination, the elephants were continuously recorded by video cameras. During the nights, the elephants typically had 1-3 recumbent sleeping/resting bouts, each lasting 1-2 h. Yawning was a regular occurrence upon arousal from a recumbency, especially in the final recumbency of the night. Yawning was significantly more frequent in some elephants. Yawning was rare during the daytime and during periods of standing around in the enclosure at night. In six occurrences of likely contagious yawning, one elephant yawned upon seeing another elephant yawning upon arousal from a final recumbency; we recorded the sex and age category of the participants. The generality of yawning in both African and Asian elephants in other environments was documented in video recordings from 39 zoological facilities. In summary, the study provides evidence that yawning does occur in both African and Asian elephants, and in African elephants, yawning was particularly associated with arousal from nighttime recumbencies.\n",

      "Contagious yawning is a form of response facilitation found in humans and other primates in which observing a model yawning enhances the chance that the observer will also yawn. Because contagious yawning seems to be more easily triggered when models are conspecifics or have a strong social bond with the observer, it has been proposed that contagious yawning is linked to empathy. A possible way to test this hypothesis is to analyze whether individuals' responses differ when they observe models yawning or performing different involuntary (i.e., nose wiping, scratching) and voluntary (i.e., hand closing, wrist shaking) actions that are not linked to empathy. In this study, we tested the four great ape species with two different setups by exposing them to a human experimenter repeatedly performing these actions online, and video-recorded conspecifics repeatedly performing these actions on a screen. We examined which behaviors were subject to response facilitation, whether response facilitation was triggered by both human models and video-recorded conspecifics, and whether all species showed evidence of response facilitation. Our results showed that chimpanzees yawned significantly more when and shortly after watching videos of conspecifics (but not humans) yawning than in control conditions, and they did not do so as a response to increased levels of anxiety. For all other behaviors, no species produced more target actions when being exposed to either model than under control conditions. Moreover, the individuals that were more \"reactive\" when watching yawning videos were not more reactive when exposed to other actions. Since, at least in chimpanzees, (1) subjects only showed response facilitation when they were exposed to yawning and (2) only if models were conspecifics, it appears that contagious yawning is triggered by unique mechanisms and might be linked to empathy.\n",
      "Previous research shows that yawning enhances intracranial circulation and regulates brain temperature. Consistent with these functional outcomes, yawn duration correlates positively with interspecies variation in brain weight across mammals, with robust relationships documented at both the taxonomic rank of class and the more restricted scale of family (e.g., Felidae). This study provides the first investigation into whether differences in brain weight within a single species, domesticated dogs Canis lupus familiaris, can predict intraspecific variation in yawn duration. Measures of yawn duration were obtained from public videos available online and then paired with previously published brain and body weight data of different dog breeds. The final sample consisted of 272 yawns from 198 dogs across 23 breeds. Consistent with recent studies, we find robust correlations between yawn duration and brain weight across breeds. Moreover, these correlations remain significant after controlling for differences in body weight across breeds. These findings replicate and extend upon past work in this area and provide further support that yawns evolved to serve an important and large-scale neurophysiologic function.\n",
      "The report examines the temporal sequence of yawns induced by apomorphine and whether the opiate antagonist, naloxone, affects it. Before administering apomorphine (0.075 mg/kg) or saline, rats (n = 8) were pretreated with naloxone (1 mg/kg) or saline. Each subject received all 4 possible treatments (saline-saline, saline-apomorphine, naloxone-saline, and naloxone-apomorphine) in random order. Results indicate that yawning induced by apomorphine seems to come in fits; that is, there is a series of yawns spaced closely together and followed by a period of quiescence before the start of another cluster of yawns. Naloxone reduced the number of apomorphine-induced yawns, and the occurrence of very short inter-yawn intervals. It is suggested that the timing of yawns may provide useful information regarding some pathologies and that opiates may potentiate the action of dopaminergic systems.\n",
      "Aim: There have been a few reports about 3-D sonographic observation of fetal movements using dynamic 3-D sonography. However, dynamic 3-D sonography is not real-time, the frame rate being in the region of 4-6 frames per second depending on the size of the region of interest and the number of lines employed. Recently, a new faster 3-D sonography, which acquires up to 28 frames per second, has become available. Using this system, we studied a full range of fetal facial expressions during pregnancy.\n",
      "Methods: A total of 17 normal fetuses in 16 pregnancies (15 singletons and one twin) at 20-38 weeks' gestation was studied using a transabdominal real-time 3-D ultrasound machine. This 3-D ultrasound machine proved capable of providing continuous 3-D sonographic images every 0.05 and 0.035 s. The fetal face was monitored for 15 min for each subject.\n",
      "Results: Fetal eyelid movement (fetal blinking) was observed in three of 17 fetuses (17.6%). Double blinking was identified in one fetus at 38 weeks. Various types of mouth movement (yawning, a little opening, chewing, and subtle lip movement) could be observed in nine of 17 fetuses (52.9%). In the course of yawn-like opening of the mouth, tongue movements such as tongue thrust and tongue click were clearly shown in three fetuses (17.6%). A lingula movement was also identified in the course of tongue movement.\n",
      "Conclusion: Real-time 3-D sonography provides a novel means for evaluation of fetal movement, particularly fetal facial expression, in the second and third trimesters. Real-time 3-D sonography might be an important modality in future fetal behavior research and in evaluation of fetal well-being.\n",

      "While spontaneous yawning is common across all vertebrate classes, contagious yawning is less common and has been observed only in a few species of social animals. Interspecific contagious yawning in response to yawning by humans has been observed only by chimpanzees and dogs. After confirming additional occurrences of intraspecific contagious yawning in a group of captive African elephants previously studied, we further investigated the potential for the same group of elephants to engage in interspecific contagious yawning with familiar human handlers. Ten captive African elephants, most of whom had been previously studied, were observed over 13 nights for evidence of intraspecific contagious yawning. Seven of these elephants were also involved in trials where familiar handlers performed staged yawns, as well as trials with staged non-yawning gapes, or trials with no yawns or gapes. Incorporating previously collected contagious yawning data, we describe nine instances of intraspecific contagious yawning in the elephants. Three of the seven elephants yawned contagiously in response to humans during the interspecific yawning trials. This is the first report of interspecific contagious yawning by elephants in response to yawns by familiar humans.\n"

      "Objective: Curcumin is a major constituent of turmeric and influences many functions of the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effect of curcumin on yawning induced by apomorphine in rats.\n",
      "Materials and methods: Curcumin administered orally for 10 consecutive days. Yawning was induced by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of apomorphine (a dopamine receptor agonist) and the number of yawns was recorded for a period of 30 min.\n",
      "Results: Apomorphine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) produced yawning. Haloperidol (a dopamine receptors antagonist) at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg partially and at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg completely inhibited apomorphine-induced yawning. Curcumin alone produced no yawning, whereas at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg, it increased yawning induced by 0.1 mg/kg of apomorphine. Curcumin at the high doses (30 and 60 mg/kg) produced yawning when apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg) action was partially blocked with 0.5 mg/kg of haloperidol. In the presence of complete blockade of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg) action with 0.2 mg/kg of haloperidol, curcumin did not produce yawning.\n",
      "Conclusion: The results showed that curcumin at high doses increased apomorphine-induced yawning. In the presence of partial, but not complete blockade of apomorphine action, curcumin produced yawning. Curcumin produced a dopamine-like effect on yawning.\n",

      "Materials and methods: In ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized rats, a guide cannula was implanted in the right ventricle of the brain and yawning induced by i.c.v. injection of histamine. Crocin and safranal were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected alone and before i.c.v. injection of histamine.\n",
      "Results: Histamine at the doses of 10 and 20 µg/rat produced yawning. Mepyramine (a histamine H1 receptor antagonist) 40 µg/rat significantly (p<0.05) prevented histamine (20 µg/rat)-induced yawning. Crocin (30 mg/kg) and safranal (1 mg/kg) significantly (p<0.05) increased histamine (10 µg/rat)-induced yawning. Crocin and safranal also induced yawning when injected before mepyramine plus histamine administration.\n",
      "Conclusion: The results of the present study showed a yawning-inducing effect for central histamine, which was inhibited by mepyramine. Crocin and safranal increased histamine-induced yawning, and also produced yawning when the histamine action is blocked.\n",

      "YAWNING IS A COMMON PHYSIOLOGICAL EVENT THAT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES: a long inspiratory phase, a brief acme and a rapid expiration. The aim of yawning is not yet well defined. However this semi-voluntary event increases vigilance and aims to alert when drowsiness occurs. Yawning probably has an important role for social communication as well. Yawning can be responsible for pain, luxation or even transient ischaemic attack. Abnormal yawning is present in various pathologies: migraine, Parkinson's disease, tumours, psychiatric diseases, infections or iatrogenic pathologies. The neuro-pharmacology of yawning is complex and knowledge of its mechanisms is incomplete. While under the control of several neurotransmitters, yawning is largely affected by dopamine. Dopamine may activate oxytocin production in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Oxytocin may then activate cholinergic transmission in the hippocampus and, finally, acetylcholine might induce yawning via the muscarinic receptors of the effectors. This is an over-simplification; many other molecules can modulate yawning, such as nitric oxide, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, ACTH, MSH, sexual hormones and opium derivate peptides. Dopamine involvement in yawning could have practical applications in the study of new drugs or the exploration of neurological diseases such as migraine or psychosis. 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd\n",
      "Over the past 5 years numerous reports have confirmed and replicated the specific brain cooling and thermal window predictions derived from the thermoregulatory theory of yawning, and no study has found evidence contrary to these findings. Here we review the comparative research supporting this model of yawning among homeotherms, while highlighting a recent report showing how the expression of contagious yawning in humans is altered by seasonal climate variation. The fact that yawning is constrained to a thermal window of ambient temperature provides unique and compelling support in favor of this theory. Heretofore, no existing alternative hypothesis of yawning can explain these results, which have important implications for understanding the potential functional role of this behavior, both physiologically and socially, in humans and other animals. In discussion we stress the broader applications of this work in clinical settings, and counter the various criticisms of this theory.\n",
      "Yawning behaviour has been associated with a variety of physiological and social events and a number of corresponding functions have been attributed to it. Non-directed (self-directed behaviour) and directed yawning (display behaviour) might nonetheless encompass all expressions of yawning, although it is difficult to differentiate one type from the other in a social context. Here we analysed more fully the data from a study in which four combinations of sensory cues were presented to pairs of either cage mate or stranger rats. The aim of the re-analysis was to demonstrate that non-directed and directed yawning might be identified by their distinctive functions. All pairs of rats used olfactory cues to recognise each other as stranger or cage mate companions, but only stranger rats used auditory cues to detect and respond to each other's yawning. Increasing defecation rates (i.e. an index of emotional reactivity) inhibited yawning in cage mate rats such that yawning frequency reflected each rat's physiological state. These results suggest that non-directed yawning functions as a cue in cage mate rats and directed yawning as a signal in stranger rats. We hypothesize that cue yawning might be a regulatory act that animals perform to adjust muscle tone for a coordinated change of state. Signal yawning might indicate the physiological capacity of rats in male-male conflicts.\n",

      "Recent research suggests that yawning is an adaptive behavior that functions to promote brain thermoregulation among homeotherms. To explore the relationship between brain temperature and yawning we implanted thermocoupled probes in the frontal cortex of rats to measure brain temperature before, during and after yawning. Temperature recordings indicate that yawns and stretches occurred during increases in brain temperature, with brain temperatures being restored to baseline following the execution of each of these behaviors. The circulatory changes that accompany yawning and stretching may explain some of the thermal similarities surrounding these events. These results suggest that yawning and stretching may serve to maintain brain thermal homeostasis.\n",

      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in driver drowsiness detection based on the extraction of deep features of drivers' faces. However, the performance of driver drowsiness detection methods decreases sharply when complications, such as illumination changes in the cab, occlusions and shadows on the driver's face, and variations in the driver's head pose, occur. In addition, current driver drowsiness detection methods are not capable of distinguishing between driver states, such as talking versus yawning or blinking versus closing eyes. Therefore, technical challenges remain in driver drowsiness detection. In this article, we propose a novel and robust two-stream spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (2s-STGCN) for driver drowsiness detection to solve the above-mentioned challenges. To take advantage of the spatial and temporal features of the input data, we use a facial landmark detection method to extract the driver's facial landmarks from real-time videos and then obtain the driver drowsiness detection result by 2s-STGCN. Unlike existing methods, our proposed method uses videos rather than consecutive video frames as processing units. This is the first effort to exploit these processing units in the field of driver drowsiness detection. Moreover, the two-stream framework not only models both the spatial and temporal features but also models both the first-order and second-order information simultaneously, thereby notably improving driver drowsiness detection. Extensive experiments have been performed on the yawn detection dataset (YawDD) and the National TsingHua University drowsy driver detection (NTHU-DDD) dataset. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method. This method achieves an average accuracy of 93.4% on the YawDD dataset and an average accuracy of 92.7% on the evaluation set of the NTHU-DDD dataset.\n"

      "The forms and behavioral correlates of yawning are described, and the phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of the act are examined with particular attention to its possible functions. Much evidence supports the view that yawning is an important mediator of behavioral arousal levels, a view that is further strengthened by a review of endocrine, neurotransmitter, and pharmacological mechanisms of yawning: A major function of yawning appears to involve maintenance or increase of arousal when environments provide relatively little stimulation.\n",

      "Yawning, a physiologic reflex exhibited by vertebrates, is seldom noticed as a symptom of a disease. Not too often is a patient aware of it as a symptom, unless it is of such a distressing nature to seek attention. In this situation, to distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior would pose a diagnostic dilemma for the attending physician. Intractable yawning has been a presenting symptom of many pathologic states such as stroke, epilepsy, and migraine. Literature is sparse regarding intractable yawning caused by tumors of the brain. Most of the time, the etiology cited is the infratentorial location of these tumors causing compression of the brainstem and the centers responsible for yawning. Intractable yawning as a predominant symptom of supratentorial tumor is rare. We present a case of an 18-year-old girl who presented with abnormal yawning. On evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor in the posterior part of the inferior temporal gyrus. There was no significant compression of the brainstem structures to suggest this as a cause for her symptom. She underwent a craniotomy and total excision of lesion. Postoperatively, her symptoms improved and her salvos of yawns ceased. The histopathological examination revealed a ganglioglioma of the temporal lobe. The present case is unique as it is the only case reported in the literature of a supratentorial tumor causing abnormal yawning.\n",

      "Background and purpose: Yawning is a stereotypical complex muscular movement and is commonly executed by most vertebrates. In seconds, the entire airway is fully dilated and surrounding muscles are powerfully stretched, most prominently around the pharynx. To date, yawning has been rarely studied, and as of yet there is no consensus on its main function.\n",
      "Material and methods: To investigate a mechanical airway function for yawning, a literature search was conducted to relate the frequency of yawning and obstructive airway conditions.\n",
      "Results: The results show that changes in obstructive airway conditions and alteration of the frequency of yawning are temporally related.\n",
      "Interpretation: These relationships, however, cannot be interpreted as causal, nor can they be extrapolated to explain the function of yawning. Yet airway management and yawning share many physiological characteristics. We therefore propose a novel hypotheses: yawning plays a significant role in airway physiology by muscle repositioning and widening the airway lumen, thereby securing long-term oxygenation.\n",

      "Yawning appears to be involved in arousal, state change, and activity across vertebrates. Recent research suggests that yawning may support effective changes in mental state or vigilance through cerebral cooling. To further investigate the relationship between yawning, state change, and thermoregulation, 12 Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were exposed to a total of two hours of ambient temperature manipulation over a period of 48 hours. Using a repeated measures design, each rat experienced a range of increasing (22→32°C), decreasing (32→22°C), and constant temperatures (22°C; 32°C). Yawning and locomotor activity occurred most frequently during initial changes in temperature, irrespective of direction, compared to more extended periods of temperature manipulation. The rate of yawning also diminished during constant high temperatures (32°C) compared to low temperatures (22°C). Unlike yawning, however, stretching was unaffected by ambient temperature variation. These findings are compared to recent work on budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), and the ecological selective pressures for yawning in challenging thermal environments are discussed. The results support previous comparative research connecting yawning with arousal and state change, and contribute to refining the predictions of the thermoregulatory hypothesis across vertebrates.\n",

      "Chronic treatment with haloperidol, physostigmine and scopolamine exerted different effects on the frequency of yawning induced by apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.), physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) and pilocarpine (4 mg/kg, i.p.) as compared with chronic treatment with saline. Haloperidol decreased the apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawning but not the pilocarpine-induced yawning. Physostigmine reduced only the pilocarpine-induced yawning without affecting the apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawning. However, physostigmine showed the most rapid onset- and peak-time of yawning induced by a high dose of physostigmine (0.75 mg/kg, i.p.) as well as that of pilocarpine (8 mg/kg, i.p.), and potentiated apomorphine (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced stereotypy, as compared with that observed in the saline group. Scopolamine potentiated the physostigmine- and pilocarpine-induced yawning but not the apomorphine-induced yawning. A single pretreatment with scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), however, depressed these yawning responses. The results suggest that yawning induced by physostigmine, but not by pilocarpine, may be modified by long-term treatment with haloperidol. The stereotypy mediated by the postsynaptic dopaminergic system, but not the yawning mediated by the presynaptic system, may be altered by chronic treatment with physostigmine, while long-term treatment with scopolamine seems to produce a supersensitivity to cholinergic receptors.\n",
      "A behavioral study was performed in an attempt to understand the neurological mechanism involved in yawning in rats. Intraperitoneal injections of low doses (0.25 mg/kg) of apomorphine, which preferentially activate presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, elicited yawning. Whereas apomorphine, at a high dose of 2 mg/kg, produces stereotypy which has been thought to be mediated by stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors. The yawning and stereotypy did not occur simultaneously in the rat. The apomorphine-induced yawning was completely inhibited by pretreatment with fluphenazine (9 mg/kg, IM) or scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg IP), but markedly increased by reserpine (5 mg/kg, SC), however it was not affected by methylscopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, IP). Both physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg, IP), an indirect acetylcholine agonist, and pilocarpine (4 mg/kg, IP), a direct acetylcholine agonist, also induced yawning. This was abolished by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, IP) and increased by reserpine (5 mg/kg, SC). Fluphenazine (9 mg/kg, IP) did not affect the pilocarpine-induced yawning but increased the physostigmine-induced yawning. The results indicate that apomorphine elicits yawning by stimulating presynaptic dopamine receptors, and that dopaminergic inhibition and cholinergic activation are concomitantly involved in the yawning.\n",

      "Yawning during hyperventilation occurred in certain patients post-thalamotomy. It was found that all of the lesions which elicited yawning (during the routine recording of electroencephalograms) were localized to the medial portion of the center-median nucleus. Yawning was noted to persist up to 3(1/2) years post surgery. Another group of patients who yawned when hyperventilated were patients with a history of a recent head injury who showed post-traumatic behavioral changes. Patients in both groups were young. There was no direct relationship between yawning and EEG abnormality. It was suggested that yawning during hyperventilation may serve as a sign of brain damage, especially at the brain stem level, in young patients.\n"

      "Yawning behaviour in rats was studied by direct observation. Apomorphine dose dependently induced yawning: 0.05 mg/kg was most effective, 0.2 mg/kg induced locomotor and sniffing behaviour but less yawning. Sulpinide (2 and 10 mg/kg) dose dependently blocked the apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced yawning. (+)-3-PPP (1-10 mg/kg) induced yawning in a manner similar to that of apomorphine but (-)-3-PPP (1-10 mg/kg) did so only weakly. Yawning induced by (+)-3-PPP was blocked by sulpiride 10 mg/kg. It is concluded that (+)-3-PPP but not (-)-3-PPP is at least as effective as apomorphine to induce yawning in rats, indicating that (+)-3-PPP, but not (-)-3-PPP, is a pure agonist on dopamine autoreceptors.\n",

      "Most previous studies suggest diminished susceptibility to contagious yawning in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it could be driven by their atypical attention to the face. To test this hypothesis, children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children were shown yawning and control movies. To ensure participants' attention to the face, an eye tracker controlled the onset of the yawning and control stimuli. Results demonstrated that both TD children and children with ASD yawned more frequently when they watched the yawning stimuli than the control stimuli. It is suggested therefore that the absence of contagious yawning in children with ASD, as reported in previous studies, might relate to their weaker tendency to spontaneously attend to others' faces.\n",
      "The efficacy of several drugs to elicit yawning and penile erections were determined in rats. The dopamine agonists, N-propylnorapomorphine, apomorphine, pergolide, (+/-)-3-PPP, TL-99 and N,N-dipropylamino-5,6-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (N,N-dipropyl A-5,6-DTN) all elicited yawning accompanied by an increase in spontaneous penile erections. The potencies of these drugs in causing yawning closely resemble published data concerning their actions in biochemical tests reputedly indicative of autoreceptor activity. In contrast, SK&F 38393, A-5,6-DTN and clonidine produced no yawning and few or no penile erections. Although physostigmine also caused yawning, the effect was not accompanied by penile erections. Studies with the optical isomers of 3-PPP showed that (+)-3-PPP was considerably more potent than (-)-3-PPP. Haloperidol antagonised dopamine agonist-induced yawning and penile erections. Apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections were also antagonised by sulpiride and atropine but not by domperidone. The suitability of elicitation of the combined syndrome of yawning plus penile erections as useful behavioural model for dopamine autoreceptor agonists is discussed.\n",
      "Yawning was induced in rats by the (+) enantiomer of 3PPP, while (-)-3PPP was inactive. Yawning was present 24, but not 1, 6 and 12 h after reserpine treatment. The (+)-3PPP-induced yawning was antagonized by haloperidol and sulpiride but not by domperidone. Reserpine-induced yawning was antagonized by sulpiride and by alpha-methyltyrosine suggesting that this behavior may be induced by endogenously released dopamine. Reserpine-pretreatment potentiated (+)-3PPP-induced yawning. The results argue against the view that yawning is the behavioural correlate of autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of DA transmission, and suggest that this behaviour is due to the stimulation of a special population of central postsynaptic DA receptors.\n",
      "Physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent, elicited yawning with a marked protrusion of the tongue and teeth chattering. Yawning and chattering were also observed after pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist predominantly acting upon muscarinic receptors. Apomorphine at low doses (0.1-0.5 mg/kg), which preferentially activates presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, elicited yawning, whereas at high doses (1-2 mg/kg) it produced stereotypy. Yawning induced by both cholinergic agonists and apomorphine was inhibited by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor blocking agent, but not by methylscopolamine, a peripheral anticholinergic agent and mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor blocking agent. Low dose (0.02 mg/kg) of haloperidol, which has been reported to block presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, inhibited apomorphine-induced yawning but did not affect cholinergic agonist-induced yawning. Physostigmine-elicited tongue protruding was inhibited by mecamylamine. The results imply that yawning behavior is essentially associated with the stimulation of central muscarinic receptors, and that physostigmine also induces tongue protruding by activating the central nicotinic receptors.\n",
      "In humans and apes, yawn contagion echoes emotional contagion, the basal layer of empathy. Hence, yawn contagion is a unique tool to compare empathy across species. If humans are the most empathic animal species, they should show the highest empathic response also at the level of emotional contagion. We gathered data on yawn contagion in humans (Homo sapiens) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) by applying the same observational paradigm and identical operational definitions. We selected a naturalistic approach because experimental management practices can produce different psychological and behavioural biases in the two species, and differential attention to artificial stimuli. Within species, yawn contagion was highest between strongly bonded subjects. Between species, sensitivity to others' yawns was higher in humans than in bonobos when involving kin and friends but was similar when considering weakly-bonded subjects. Thus, emotional contagion is not always highest in humans. The cognitive components concur in empowering emotional affinity between individuals. Yet, when they are not in play, humans climb down from the empathic podium to return to the \"understory\", which our species shares with apes.\n",
      "A number of centrally active drugs were tested for antagonism of physostigmine- or apomorphine-induced yawning and for apomorphine-induced penile erections. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists piperoxan and idazoxan inhibited the yawning response without affecting the penile erections. The 5HT agonist quipazine and the histamine antagonist dexchlorpheniramine inhibited the yawning response more effectively than the penile erections. Dexchlorpheniramine even enhanced the apomorphine-induced penile erections and induced penile erections in physostigmine-treated rats. The 5HT antagonists metergoline and methysergide blocked the apomorphine-induced penile erections without affecting the yawning response. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, the dopamine antagonist sulpiride, the antihistaminic mepyramine and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide inhibited both yawning and penile erections at the same dose level. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and phenoxybenzamine were inactive. It is concluded that yawning and penile erections can be differentially affected by drug treatments. Also, while concomitant yawning and penile erections can be selectively induced by a class of dopamine receptor agonists, the same selectivity does not apply to antagonism of these induced behaviours.\n",

      "The temporal course of yawning behavior elicited by increasing doses of apomorphine (APO), from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg, was studied experimentally in adult albino rats. In the higher dose range a great prolongation of drug induced yawning latency is observed. This result is explainable by postulating differences in sensitivity of two sets of dopaminergic (DA) receptors: low threshold presynaptic DA receptors which, when activated, disinhibit yawning, and high threshold postsynaptic DA receptors inhibiting yawning. Apomorphine in high doses can entirely suppress physostigmine-elicited yawning.\n",
      "Although yawning is a commonly witnessed human behavior, yet it has not been taught in much detail in medical schools because, until the date, no particular physiological significance has been associated with it. It is characterized by opening up of mouth which is accompanied by a long inspiration, with a brief interruption of ventilation and followed by a short expiration. Since time immemorial, yawning has been associated with drowsiness and boredom. However, this age old belief is all set to change as the results of some newer studies have pointed out that yawning might be a way by which our body is trying to accomplish some more meaningful goals. In this review, we have tried to put together some of the important functions that have been proposed by a few authors, with the hope that this article will stimulate the interest of newer researchers in this hitherto unexplored field.\n"

      "The serotonergic agents LSD (0.01-0.05 mg/kg) and lisuride (0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg) elicited a high frequency of limb flicking in the cat after IP doses; LSD, but not lisuride, elicited a significantly increased frequency of yawning as well. In combination, LSD plus lisuride (0.025 mg/kg each) gave additive frequencies of limb flicking, but the frequency of yawning was half that after LSD alone. The dopamine agonist apomorphine had no significant effect on either yawning or limb flicking over the dose range 0.006 to 3.2 mg/kg. Pretreatment of cats with 1.0 mg/kg of apomorphine (but not with 0.05 mg/kg) significantly reduced the frequency of yawning elicited by 0.01 or 0.025 mg/kg of LSD, but had no effect on limb flicking. The dopamine antagonist haloperidol had no effect on limb flicking at doses from 0.008 to 0.512 mg/kg, but produced a significantly increased frequency of yawning at 0.256 mg/kg, an effect antagonized by lisuride administration. Given that lisuride has more potent dopamine agonist properties than LSD, these results are consistent with serotonergic elicitation of yawning, dopaminergic inhibition of yawning, and with their concomitant interaction in the expression of drug-induced yawning in the cat. The behavioral pharmacologies of limb flicking and yawning are different in this species.\n",
      "The possible interaction between cholinergic and dopaminergic influences in the induction of yawning behavior in the rat is explored resorting to several experimental approaches: comparison of the ontogeny of yawning behavior induced by physostigmine (0.15 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg); simultaneous injection of both drugs; \"crossed blocking\" experiments, in which the action of the cholinomimetic agent is examined after injection of spiroperidol (0.05 mg/kg) and that of apomorphine after scopolamine (0.25 mg/kg). While physostigmine-elicited yawning is highest in early postnatal days and tends to decline from the 7th day onwards, reaching its lowest level around 3 wk, yawning induced by apomorphine begins around the 9th day and increases thereafter to a plateau that is reached in the third week. No synergism on yawning behavior is observed by simultaneous injection of optimal or suboptimal doses of physostigmine and apomorphine. Scopolamine blocks apomorphine-induced yawning; spiroperidol blocks apomorphine- but potentiates physostigmine-induced yawning, both in 15-day-old and young adult rats. Two 5-HT uptake blockers, citalopram (10-20 mg/kg) and fluoxetin (10-20 mg/kg) potentiate physostigmine - but not apomorphine-elicited yawning. On the basis of these results a tentative model of \"in series\" organization of dopaminergic and cholinergic influences on yawning behavior is proposed.\n",
      "Circadian variation of spontaneous yawning is demonstrated in a line of Sprague-Dawley rats, genetically selected for high frequency of this motor pattern. Yawning is highest in late light and early dark hours, both under natural and artificial illumination. The hypothetical neurotransmitters underlying this physiological rhythm in yawning are discussed.\n",

      "The effects of pretreatment with drugs on drug-induced yawning and penile erection in intact and chronically castrated rats were investigated. Naloxone partially blocked yawning in intact rats and in castrated rats pretreated with dihydro-testosterone propionate (DHTP) but not in control castrates. In contrast, naloxone potentiated apomorphine-induced penile erections in intact rats. Morphine, haloperidol and atropine blocked yawning and penile erections. Methyl naloxone, methyl atropine and domperidone at doses which are selectively peripheral-acting had no effect on drug-induced yawning or penile erection indicating that both effects are mediated centrally. Pretreatment with morphine did not change the naloxone effects in intact rats. The results indicate a naloxone-androgen interaction in drug-induced yawning but the results with morphine are not consistent with a role of opiates in this interaction. The penile erection data support a direct opiate-dopamine receptor interaction in this response. The haloperidol and atropine effects support a cholinergic-dopaminergic interaction in both yawning and penile erections.\n",

      "Yawning behaviour in rats injected subcutaneously with antidepressant drugs was studied by direct observation. Desipramine (0.1-30 mg/kg) elicited yawning that began 15-20 min after injection and lasted for 60 min, and the dose-response curve showed a bell-shaped form. Desipramine (10 mg/kg) elicited the maximal effect (mean number of yawns 13.6). Haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg), spiperone (0.2 mg/kg), pimozide (4 mg/kg), reserpine (7.5 mg/kg), alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (250 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg) markedly reduced yawning induced by desipramine, whereas prazosin (1 mg/kg) and phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg) were without effect. These findings indicate that desipramine induces yawning by a dopaminergic mechanism, and that endogenous dopamine (DA) is necessary for its occurrence. Yawning was observed also after administration of imipramine, clomipramine, trazodone, its metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine and (+/-)sulpiride. These drugs given in a similar dose-range to desipramine produced a weaker effect than desipramine. Selective and potent inhibitors of the uptake of noradrenaline (NA) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), (+)oxaprotiline and citalopram, did not elicit yawning. A possibility is considered that certain antidepressant drugs induced yawning through an influence on dopaminergic system.\n",
      "The occurrence of sustained yawning, uncoupled from sedation but caused by psychotropic medication, has been noted infrequently in the literature. This case report suggests the possibility of an association between imipramine and sustained yawning. Mechanisms of action for this yawning are proposed and a treatment strategy is offered.\n",

It is an ambitious bill with very tight time frames, vague language, and heavy reliance on regional commissions and volunteer groups that are just now being established. Will it have an impact on rural health care? Undoubtedly, it will.

      "Herein we report that subcutaneous injection of low doses of ovine prolactin (oPRL) induce yawning in young adult male rats. The most effective dose of oPRL in evoking yawning was 0.25 microgram/kg body weight (5.2 yawns/60 min at 1000 hr vs 0.3 in control animals). Doses of 0.025, 0.05, 2.5, 25, and 250 micrograms/kg were less effective. Interestingly, yawning in response to oPRL changes over the course of one circadian cycle with highest frequency at 1600 hr (11 yawns/80 min vs 2 yawns/80 min in animals injected with boiled oPRL). The onset of yawning in most oPRL-treated rats began approximately 40 min after oPRL injection, whereas with apomorphine the latency to the response was about 10 min. These results indicate that oPRL in addition to other hypophysial peptides such as ACTH and MSH can stimulate yawning. It is proposed that PRL after initial activation of the nigrostriatal dopamine system secondarily induces yawning by inhibition of this system via an autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback mechanism. This may explain the long latency to the response.\n",
      "In a Sprague-Dawley-derived line of rats, selectively bred to establish a high incidence of spontaneous yawning behavior, the simultaneous and systematic monitoring of yawning and penile erections, during observation periods of one hour, demonstrates a linear correlation between these two behavioral patterns. Dose-effect curves of yawning and penile erections elicited by apomorphine and bromocriptine, and their inhibition by metoclopramide are quite similar. These results strongly suggest that yawning and penile erection are subject to some common regulating and modulating mechanisms, one of which seems to involve dopaminergic pathways.\n",
      "The administration of a small dose of apomorphine (50 micrograms/kg s.c.) induced repeated episodes of yawning in male rats. Short-term (3 days) treatment with 17 beta-estradiol antagonized apomorphine-induced yawning in male rats. Moreover, apomorphine induced yawning much less effectively in female than in male rats. These results suggest that both endogenous or exogenously administered estrogens induce subsensitivity of the DA receptors mediating yawning in rats.\n",
      "The ontogenetic course of two cholinergically mediated central neuropharmacological effects, yawning and potentiation of head-shaking induced by D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg), was explored in developing rats. Physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (4 mg/kg) evoke stereotyped yawning in neonatal rats, the effect declining in the middle of the second week of life. Both cholinomimetic drugs strongly potentiate amphetamine induced head-shaking between the 4th and 10th postnatal days. Pilocarpine per se is capable of inducing head-shaking, in the absence of amphetamine, in rats from 8 to 12 days. Infant rat yawning and head-shaking are blocked by scopolamine (5 mg/kg). Nicotine (0.1 mg/kg) potentiates head-shaking but inhibits yawning. Yawning is also depressed by D-amphetamine. The early maturation of these cholinergic effects is discussed in comparison to the later maturation of several forebrain cholinergic systems.\n",
      "Yawning induced by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of physostigmine (0.15 mgKg-1), in infant or adult rats is potentiated by Lu 10-171 (0.5-10 mgKg-1), a selective serotonin uptake inhibiting drug, which, by itself does not induce yawning. This effect is counteracted by metergoline (5-10 mgKg-1, IP) which blocks serotonin postsynaptic receptors. It is suggested that serotonin may exert a positivie modulating effect on yawning.\n",

      "Psychological, clinical and neurobiological findings endorse that empathic abilities are more developed in women than in men. Because there is growing evidence that yawn contagion is an empathy-based phenomenon, we expect that the female bias in the empathic abilities reflects on a gender skew in the responsiveness to others' yawns. We verified this assumption by applying a linear model on a dataset gathered during a 5 year period of naturalistic observations on humans. Gender, age and social bond were included in the analysis as fixed factors. The social bond and the receiver's gender remained in the best model. The rates of contagion were significantly lower between acquaintances than between friends and family members, and significantly higher in women than in men. These results not only confirm that yawn contagion is sensitive to social closeness, but also that the phenomenon is affected by the same gender bias affecting empathy. The sex skew, also found in other non-human species, fits with the female social roles which are likely to require higher empathic abilities (e.g. parental care, group cohesion maintenance, social mediation). The fact that female influence in social dynamics also relies on face-to-face emotional exchange raises concerns on the negative repercussions of having women's facial expressions forcibly concealed.\n",
      "The behavioural effects of systemic and intrastriatal injections of the dopamine agonists piribedil and apomorphine in male rats were examined. Bilateral application of piribedil (50 and 100 micrograms) or apomorphine (5, 10 and 20 micrograms) to the striatum produced yawning and chewing mouth movements accompanied by intermittent stretching and sexual arousal. Low doses of piribedil (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) injected SC produced an identical yawning syndrome. Previous work has suggested that yawning elicited by systemic dopamine agonist treatment is a consequence of dopamine autoreceptor stimulation. Similarly, the most likely explanation of the present data is that yawning elicited by systemic and central dopamine agonist treatment was due to activation of dopamine autoreceptors. Systemic injection of haloperidol and scopolamine abolished yawning induced by intrastriatal piribedil and these data provide tentative support for the proposal that a dopamine-acetylcholine link may be involved in the expression of yawning.\n",
      "In relatively small doses, the four \"atypical\" neuroleptics, sulpiride, clozapine, thoiridazine and mezilamine were effective antagonists of apomorphine-induced yawning in rats. Of the four drugs, used in doses which inhibited apomorphine-induced yawning almost completely, only clozapine also antagonized yawning induced by physostigmine. Therefore it appears that the antagonism of this effect of apomorphine, already reported for classical neuroleptic agents, is also shown by \"atypical\" ones. By combining apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawning, it is possible to assess the anticholinergic component in the antagonism of this effect of apomorphine and this may be of value for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the \"atypical\" character.\n",

      "The subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg/kg apomorphine induced a syndrome consisting of yawning, chewing and sexual arousal in male rats. Bilateral lesions of the striatum induced with 6-hydroxydopamine abolished the drug-induced yawning, chewing and sexual arousal and produced a 58% depletion of the concentrations of dopamine in the striatum. These data suggest that apomorphine-induced yawning is mediated by presynaptic dopamine receptors (which may be autoreceptors). Furthermore, it appears that dopaminergic innervation of the striatum may play an important role in the production of yawning elicited by small doses of dopamine agonists.\n",

      "A 60-year-old man suffering from recurrent attacks of yawning-fatigue-syndrome, triggered by mild exercise of his right leg since a temporary lumbar disc herniation 9 years ago, was initially treated with the oral µ-opioid-receptor agonist tilidine before each bout of exercise (see Dibaj et al. 2019 JAMA Neurology 2019;77:254). During the first few months, this treatment continuously prolonged the time without exercise-triggered yawning and fatigue. In the next few months of treatment, exercise was increased in a graded manner to alleviate the yawning-fatigue-syndrome. The number of repetitions of the physical exercises was gradually increased without taking the opioid beforehand. After several months, almost the same effort level without medication could be achieved by graded activity as before under the influence of opioid medication. Graded physical activity can thus disrupt complex pathophysiological mechanisms leading to yawning and fatigue.\n",
      "Dopaminergic agonists, apomorphine (APO) (0.025-0.25 mg/kg, s.c.), TL-99 (0.5-3 mg/kg, s.c.) and 3-PPP (0.15-10 mg/kg, s.c.) elicited yawning in rats and the dose-response curves of all 3 compounds showed a bell-shaped form. Haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the yawning induced by DA-agonists to about 50%. The potencies of the DA-agonists in inducing yawning were APO greater than TL-99 greater than 3-PPP (comparable to potencies obtained in other in vivo tests, determining DA-ergic activity). The findings support the validity of the yawning phenomenon as a screening test for DA-agonists. Additionally, it was found that apomorphine induced yawning was significantly and dose-dependently enhanced by the beta-agonist, formoterol. This effect was counteracted by scopolamine, not changed by metergoline and further increased by l-propranolol. These data support the hypothesis of cholinergic involvement in yawning and indicate a role, though unclear at present, of beta-receptors in this behaviour.\n",

      "Resonance is the phenomenon of one person unconsciously mirroring the motor actions as basis of emotional expressions of another person. This shared representation serves as a basis for sharing physiological and emotional states of others and is an important component of empathy. Contagious laughing and contagious yawning are examples of resonance. In the interpersonal contact with individuals with schizophrenia we can often experience impaired empathic resonance. The aim of this study is to determine differences in empathic resonance-in terms of contagion by yawning and laughing-in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls in the context of psychopathology and social functioning. We presented video sequences of yawning, laughing or neutral faces to 43 schizophrenia outpatients and 45 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Participants were video-taped during the stimulation and rated regarding contagion by yawning and laughing. In addition, we assessed self-rated empathic abilities (Interpersonal Reactivity Index), psychopathology (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale in the schizophrenia group resp. Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire in the control group), social dysfunction (Social Dysfunction Index) and executive functions (Stroop, Fluency). Individuals with schizophrenia showed lower contagion rates for yawning and laughing. Self-rated empathic concern showed no group difference and did not correlate with contagion. Low rate of contagion by laughing correlated with the schizophrenia negative syndrome and with social dysfunction. We conclude that impaired resonance is a handicap for individuals with schizophrenia in social life. Blunted observable resonance does not necessarily reflect reduced subjective empathic concern.\n"

Knowledge gained was retained over a four-week period and the addition of physician-led talks appeared to add little to the knowledge gained. \"Air Academy: The Quest for Airtopia\" is an easy and successful tool for elementary grade asthma-related health education in schools.\n",
      "Although there have been previous reports of decreased sexual capacity as a side effect of antidepressants (1-3), the authors know of no previous records of increased capacity of the type described in the following reports, or of reports of side effects associated with yawning. Observation of unusual yawning-associated side effects is now reported, in order to alert clinicians to a possible side effect that can influence patient-compliance with the prescribed medication regimen.\n",

      "Prematurity and low birthweight are the leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality. Minnesota has developed public and private programs to deal with preterm-birth and low-birthweight prevention. With the new programs have come multiple forms, care delivery systems, and reimbursement schedules. The diversity and multiplicity of programs can be frustrating and confusing for primary care physicians. A better understanding of the goals and components of low-birthweight prevention programs such as the Prenatal Care Initiative and the preterm-birth prevention programs used by many practitioners may facilitate the use of such programs. This article compares and contrasts low-birthweight prevention and preterm-birth prevention.\n",
      "Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of infant mortality from infection. A rapid screening immunoassay for GBS was evaluated in a rural obstetrical population and was found to have an unacceptably low specificity (90%) and sensitivity (50%). With a culture proven GBS colonization rate of 6.8%, the positive predictive value of the rapid screening test was only 27%, and the negative predictive value was 96%. Current recommendations for routine vaginal cultures, on all women based on urban research data with high maternal colonization rates (15%-23%) and high prematurity rates (15%-40%) are reviewed in relation to this community's low colonization and prematurity rates.\n",

      "Apomorphine (50 micrograms/kg) induced repeated episodes of yawning, penile erection and genital grooming in rats. A dose of cycloheximide, which inhibited brain protein synthesis by 50% totally prevented apomorphine-induced yawning and reduced by approximately 50% the occurrence of episodes of penile erection and genital grooming. However, this treatment failed to modify the stereotyped behaviour induced by 200 micrograms/kg of apomorphine. These results suggest that protein synthesis is required for the behavioural effects of small doses of apomorphine.\n",

Preoperative and intraoperative autologous blood collection may have to be supplemented with hemostatic pharmacologic agents. The use of cytokines is increasing. More efficient use of directed donors can have an important role in blood use. As these expensive and time-consuming techniques become available, a major challenge will be to determine which patients may benefit from or really need them.\n",

      "To assess current primary care physicians', nurse practitioners' (NP) and physicians assistants' (PA) knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and changes from a similar 2007 assessment, we surveyed attendees of 3 regional continuing medical education programs and compared the 2013/2014 responses with responses to a similar survey completed in 2007. Survey data included information on personal demographics, agreement with perceived barriers to COPD diagnosis, awareness, and use of COPD guidelines, and beliefs regarding the value of available COPD therapies. In 2013/2014, 426 primary care clinicians (278 medical doctors [MDs] and doctors of osteopathic medicine [DO] and 148 NPs/PAs) provided useable responses (overall response rate 61%). Overall these physicians were older and more experienced than the NPs/PAs but with few other differences in responses except significantly greater physician reported use of spirometry for COPD diagnosis. About half of the clinicians reported having in-office spirometers but less than two thirds reported using them for all COPD diagnoses. All respondents reported multiple barriers to COPD diagnosis but with fewer than in 2007 reporting lack of knowledge or awareness of COPD guidelines as a major barrier. The most striking difference between 2007 and 2013/2014 responses was the marked increase in beliefs by all clinicians in the ability of COPD treatments to reduce symptoms and numbers of exacerbations. These data affirm that primary care clinicians continue to report multiple barriers to COPD diagnosis including lack of easy access to spirometry and frequent failure to include spirometry in diagnostic confirmation. However, since 2007, the clinicians report a remarkable decline in therapeutic nihilism, which may enhance their interest in learning more about diagnosing and managing COPD.\n",
      "Stereotyped behavior in the schizophrenic patient is described, provoked by yawning or fragments of this act in the environment. It consists of elements that, in an ethological sense are reminiscent of activities which increase vigilance and cleanse the body. It is suggested that yawning brings about a certain 'mood transfer' which induces this kind of specific stereotyped behavior. The adequacy of an ethological interpretation of these symptoms of disease is briefly discussed.\n",
      "A low dose of the dopamine (DA) receptor agonist apomorphine (APO 0.05 mg/kg) was given repetitively and the effects were tested in three different behavioural models: reduction of spontaneous locomotion, induction of yawning and decrease in water intake in water-deprived animals. The APO-induced suppression of exploration and decrease in water intake were not affected by a previous injection of APO given 1 or 3 hours before the test dose of APO. There was a small, but significant, decrease in the induction of yawning by a previous dose of APO given 1 hour or 30 min before the test dose. However, pretreatment with APO 3 hours before the test dose did not diminish the yawning response. It is suggested that the dopaminergic mechanisms mediating APO induced yawning are different from those mediating decrease in water intake and suppression of exploration. The results are also discussed in relation to the proposed efficiency of low doses of DA agonists in the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n"

      "Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette Syndrome (TS) present as distinct conditions clinically; however, comorbidity and inhibitory control deficits have been proposed for both. Whilst such deficits have been studied widely within clinical populations, findings are mixed-partly due to comorbidity and/or medication effects-and studies have rarely distinguished between subtypes of the disorders. Studies in the general population are sparse. Using a continuity approach, the present study examined (i) the relationships between inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive aspects of ADHD and TS-like behaviors in the general population, and (ii) their unique associations with automatic and executive inhibitory control, as well as (iii) yawning (a proposed behavioral model of TS). One hundred and thirty-eight participants completed self-report measures for ADHD and TS-like behaviors as well as yawning, and a conditioned inhibition task to assess automatic inhibition. A sub-sample of fifty-four participants completed three executive inhibition tasks. An exploratory factor analysis of the TS behavior checklist supported a distinction between phonic and motor like pure TS behaviors. Whilst hyperactive/impulsive aspects of ADHD were associated with increased pure and compulsive TS-like behaviors, inattention in isolation was related to reduced obsessive-compulsive TS-like behaviors. TS-like behaviors were associated with yawning during situations of inactivity, and specifically motor TS was related to yawning during stress. Phonic TS and inattention aspects of ADHD were associated with yawning during concentration/activity. Whilst executive interference control deficits were linked to hyperactive/impulsive ADHD-like behaviors, this was not the case for inattentive ADHD or TS-like behaviors, which instead related to increased performance on some measures. No associations were observed for automatic conditioned inhibition.\n",
      "Objectives: Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint may occur for various reasons. Although different invasive methods have been advocated for its treatment, this study highlights the value of non-invasive treatment options even in chronic cases in a resource-poor environment.\n",
      "Materials and methods: A seven-year retrospective analysis of all patients managed for temporomandibular joint dislocation in our department was undertaken. Patient demographics, risk factors associated with temporomandibular joint dislocation and treatment modalities were retrieved from patient records.\n",
      "Results: In all, 26 patients were managed over a seven-year period. Males accounted for 62% of the patients, and yawning was the most frequent etiological factor. Conservative treatment methods were used successfully in 86.4% of the patients managed. Two (66.7%) of the three patients who needed surgical treatment developed complications, while only one (5.3%) patient who was managed conservatively developed complications.\n",
      "Conclusion: Temporomandibular joint dislocation appears to be associated with male sex, middle age, yawning, and low socio-economic status, although these observed relationships were not statistically significant. Non-invasive methods remain an effective treatment option in this environment in view of the low socio-economic status of the patients affected.\n",

INS are the recommended first-line therapy for all patients with AR that is greater than mild intermittent in severity. DATA SOURCE/STUDY SELECTION: Data were obtained from MEDLINE searches of all English-language articles published from January 1966 to January 2005 with the following search terms: allergic rhinitis and intranasal corticosteroid, nasal steroid, budesonide aqueous nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, mometasone furoate nasal spray, or triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray.

      "Involuntary synchronization occurs when individuals perform the same motor action patterns during a very short time lapse. This phenomenon serves an important adaptive value for animals permitting them to socially align with group fellows thus increasing integration and fitness benefits. Rapid mimicry (RM) and yawn contagion (YC) are two behavioral processes intermingled in the animal synchronization domain. Several studies demonstrated that RM and YC are socially modulated being more frequently performed by individuals sharing close relationships. This evidence highlights the relation between RM/YC and emotional contagion that is the capacity of two or more individuals to share the same affective state. In this review, we try to delineate a possible developmental trajectory of emotional sharing phenomena by using, as a model species, the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), a valid example of empathic predisposition towards individuals belonging both to the same and the different species. We contrast available findings on RM and YC in dog-dog and dog-human dyads with those in wolf-wolf dyads, in order to investigate if the ability to emotionally engage with conspecifics (wolf-wolf and dog-dog) is evolutionary rooted in canids and if provides the basis for the development of inter-specific emotional sharing (dog-human).\n",

      "Asthma continues to be a major burden for the health and healthcare of people worldwide. The recent updates of the Global Initiative for Asthma and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute asthma guidelines stress the need for achieving and monitoring asthma 'control', emphasizing the importance of identifying, assessing and treating comorbid conditions. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a major comorbid condition in people with asthma and is related to inflammation of the upper portions of the airway. Recognizing and treating AR has been shown to improve asthma control, specifically by decreasing rates of asthma attacks or asthma exacerbations. In 2008, updated Allergic Rhinitis in Asthma (ARIA) guidelines were published. The updated version of the guidelines has a familiar look, with classification systems and care algorithms that are similar to those presented in other asthma guidelines. The new ARIA guidelines make one major change that should affect the care of adults and children with asthma: everyone with asthma should be assessed for AR. In addition, AR should be considered a risk factor for asthma, and all children and adults with AR, especially persistent AR, should be assessed for asthma, including testing lung function for reversible obstruction whenever feasible. Treatment for AR follows a similar format to that for asthma, including symptom management, treatment of chronic inflammation, identification and management of triggers, including allergens, and ongoing education for self-management. Pharmacotherapies that address both asthma and AR include corticosteroids (intranasal and inhaled), leukotriene receptor antagonists, immunomodulation or immunotherapy. Too often, pharmacotherapy is not supplemented by the necessary education and evaluation related to allergen, trigger identification and management.\n"

      "Intraoperative blood salvage produces safe and clinically effective red cells. Intraoperative salvage for cardiovascular surgery procedures can be expected to cause a substantial reduction in the use of homologous red cells in patients requiring redo operations, and repair of complex aortic aneurysms. The procedure per se will have very little impact on the use of other blood components such as platelets or plasma. For carefully selected patients, autologous perioperative or intraoperative collection of these components should also be considered. The primary risks of intraoperative blood transfusion include washout of clotting proteins and platelets, infusion of undesirable constituents (such as antibiotics and haemostatic agents added during the surgical procedure) and air embolism. Intraoperative autologous transfusion is only one part of an effective programme to minimize homologous transfusion. Equally important is the use of preoperatively donated blood, the use of effective and safe pharmacological agents to enhance haemostasis and haematopoiesis, a conservative approach that allows only the transfusion of blood components absolutely necessary, and, when possible, the elimination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy several days prior to the cardiovascular surgical procedure.\n",
      "Besides sneezing, yawning, and scratching, other types of more complex behaviors can be considered urges for action, in that they are both compelling and can be overtly inhibited. Many behaviors increasing the survival rate of self and species have this instinctual (although not compulsory) nature. We feel a terrible urge to catch a newborn falling from a table, although we could choose not to do so. The hypothesis is advanced that both insula and cingulate cortex participate in social behaviors such as contagious yawning, laughing, and crying, but are not necessarily involved in the urge to cough, for example.\n",

      "Design: Intervention study; before-and-after trial.\n",
      "Setting: National cancer center.\n",
      "Patients: Forty-four patients who underwent laryngectomy; 34 men and 10 women; mean age, 64 years (range, 42-80 years); mean time since surgery, 6 years (range, 8 months to 18 years).\n",
      "Intervention: In a prospective clinical intervention study, we assessed the effectiveness of a nasal airflow-inducing maneuver (\"polite yawning,\" ie, yawning with closed lips). Speech therapists trained the patients in the maneuver, and its effectiveness in inducing nasal airflow was checked with digital and water manometers.\n",
      "Main outcome measures: Olfactory acuity was assessed before and after the intervention by means of an odor detection test and a structured questionnaire concerning olfaction, taste, and appetite. Patients were categorized as \"smellers\" and \"nonsmellers\" on the basis of the results of the odor detection test and the present odor perception scale derived from the questionnaire.\n",
      "Results: The nasal airflow-inducing maneuver could be taught to all patients, mostly in only one 30-minute therapy session. Fifteen of the 33 patients in the pretreatment nonsmeller category converted to smellers, for a success rate of 46% (P<.001).\n",

      "The cataleptogenic effect or the antagonism of apormorphine-induced behaviour (climbing, sniffing, licking and yawning) shown by haloperidol, (+/-)sulpiride and (+/-)amisulpride were determined at different times after their intraperitoneal or intraventricular administration. After intraperitoneal injection, the ED50 or ID50 of haloperidol was similar for all the behavioural responses. On the other hand, sulpiride and amisulpride were effective on climbing and yawning in smaller doses than on sniffing, licking and catalepsy. The property of amisulpride to antagonize climbing at smaller doses than sniffing was still found whether this benzamide derivative was injected 30, 90, 150 or 240 min before testing. After the intraventricular administration of neuroleptics, a dissociated antagonist efficacy appeared for haloperidol, but that of sulpiride and amisulpride became much more marked than after their intraperitoneal injection. Amisulpride antagonized climbing in smaller doses than sniffing, whether administered intraventricularly 15, 30 or 120 min before testing. These results indicate that the dissociated dopamine antagonist efficacy of benzamides is long lasting and is observed even when the passage across the blood-brain barrier is avoided (i.c.v. route).\n",

      "Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of all patients visiting the outpatient clinic, emergency department, or hospital of the Olmsted Medical Center (OMC), for an appointment or admission during January 1997 or February 1997. Patients were asked to give consent for the use of their medical records for research. Our objective was to gather information on the number and characteristics of patients who refused authorization.\n",
      "Results: Of the 15,997 patients: 90.6% granted authorization; 3.6 refused authorization; 4.5% were undecided; and 1.3% were not asked for authorization. Refusal rates were highest among patients visiting the center for mental health concerns, trauma, or eye care, and among women aged 39 years or older. Undecided rates were highest in women presenting for pregnancy care.\n",
      "Conclusions: Refusal rates were low for this community practice. However, higher refusal rates in some subgroups, such as older women or patients with mental health concerns, may increase the chance of selection bias in studies involving these patients.\n",
      "Thirty-seven patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively studied and assigned to plateletpheresis or control groups in a non-randomized, non-blinded fashion according to apheresis exclusion criteria and our ability to perform apheresis within 24 hours of surgery. Patients were grouped by potential for hemostatic abnormalities following a risk point factor assignment established for this study. The study indicated improvement of hemostasis with autologous platelets and plasma as demonstrated by clinical and laboratory parameters and by overall blood component utilization. We conclude that pre-operative plateletpheresis in this patient population is feasible, safe, and effective.\n"

      "Otitis media is a common and costly condition of childhood, with a great potential for cost savings from an effective vaccine. We present a population-based survey of the family burden of otitis media and compare it with another common childhood illness, varicella, for which vaccine prevention is available and cost-effective. We report yearly rates of affected children, complications, medication use, hospitalizations, parental work absences, and use of special sick-child day care in a population of 4557 households containing 9047 children younger than 13 years of age. Of the 9047 children in the sample, 26.1% were affected by otitis media in the year of the study; 68% of children in the second year of life had at least one episode. About one third of families lost workdays due to otitis media in their children, with an overall average loss of about 3 hours per affected child. Compared with the community burden of varicella, otitis media involves a greater total burden in terms of the number of affected children, the number of episodes, physician visits, prescription drugs, hospitalizations, and surgical procedures. Work loss was 3.4 times greater per family with a varicella case, but the number of families affected by otitis media was 3.3 times greater than for varicella, so that the total amount of family work loss was about the same for both illnesses for the year. The community burden of otitis media should be studied in a population-based longitudinal manner that includes parental work loss as well as health care costs to accurately determine the potential cost-benefit of prevention programs.\n",
      "1. Apomorphine (Apo), a short acting dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion, decreases prolactin secretion, induces yawning, penile erections and other physiological effects in man. An effect on behavior, movement disorders and alcoholism has also been described. 2. Apo-mediated responses are used to evaluate DA function in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Many of the studies in schizophrenia using the GH response to Apo as an index of central DA function are difficult to interpret because of failure to control for key variables. 3. The GH response to Apo is a useful system to evaluate the effects of various drugs including peptides which may not cross the blood brain barrier on DA function in man. 4. Apo is a potent sedative. Specific antimanic, antischizophrenic, and anticraving effects in alcoholics have not been convincingly demonstrated. Side effects of Apo and failure to use active placebo make double-blind studies difficult. 5. Apo improves parkinsonian symptoms and certain forms of reflex epilepsy but beneficial effects in other involuntary movement disorders requires further documentation. 6. Apo may be a useful agent to evaluate DA function in impotent patients and predict a therapeutic response to long-acting dopaminergic agents. 7. Impairment of DA function may play a role in diabetic impotence. 8. The development of a simple polygraphic method to monitor the yawning response to Apo may facilitate clinical studies on the basic physiology of yawning in man and the use of the yawning response as a measure of central DA function in schizophrenia and other clinical disorders. 9. The use of Apo with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to examine regional DA function in man opens up a promising area of research. 10. Though long-acting orally active aporphine DA agonists and antagonists have been developed the problem of tolerance may limit their therapeutic potential.\n",
      "Increasing doses of apomorphine (APO) induced the dose-dependent appearance of yawns in rats at doses up to 0.1 mg X kg-1 and their disappearance from 0.1 to 0.6 mg X kg-1. A similar biphasic effect on yawning was observed with increasing doses of n-propyl norapomorphine, piribedil, S 584, bromocriptine, lergotrile, lisuride, CQ 32084 and L-DOPA. APO, n-propyl norapomorphine, piribedil and CQ 32084 had similar ED50 on the induction of sniffing and on the disappearance of yawns. All the neuroleptics tested antagonized the yawns induced by 0.1 mg X kg-1 APO. Increasing doses of haloperidol, chlorpromazine, mezilamine, metoclopramide and thioridazine made the yawns reappear in rats injected with 0.6 mg X kg-1 APO. The ID50 were similar to those for the antagonism of sniffing. On the other hand, increasing doses of clozapine, (+/-)- or (-)-sulpiride, veralipride and DAN 2163 did not make the yawns reappear in rats injected with 0.6 mg X kg-1 APO although sniffing was antagonized. These results are discussed in terms of the ability of sulpiride, veralipride and DAN 2163 to distinguish between the dopamine (DA) receptors involved in the appearance of yawns at low doses of DA agonists and in their disappearance at higher doses. The decreased APO-induced yawning observed concomitantly with increased sniffing in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned olfactory tubercles suggests that yawning and sniffing could be mutually exclusive.\n",

      "The skin mucus of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis promotes escape from the American water snake Nerodia sipedon by inducing oral dyskinesias. As Xenopus mucus contains peptides and indoleamines with known neuroleptic properties, and because neuroleptics are the chief cause of drug-induced orofacial dyskinesias in humans, the hypothesis was tested that the neuroleptic haloperidol (HAL) would induce oral dyskinesias when given alone and would potentiate dyskinesias in Nerodia if injected prior to oral application of Xenopus mucus. Mucus alone induced yawning, gaping, fixed yawning, fixed gaping, writhing tongue movements, gular and chewing movements, and climbing behavior, but attenuated locomotor activity. HAL given IP alone at 0.05 and 0.5 microgram/g was ineffective. However, HAL greatly potentiated mucus-induced yawning but attenuated the fixed gaping seen when only mucus was applied. Data support the hypothesis that Xenopus skin mucus has neuroleptic properties and that Xenopus' antipredatory defense is in part related to chemical induction of orofacial and climbing behavior in snake predators.\n",
      "The dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine in experiments on rats in low doses (0.025-0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) induced yawning which reflected a selective activation of presynaptic dopamine receptors. In high doses (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) apomorphine induced stereotyped sniffing and yawning in consequence of postsynaptic D2 receptor activation. Dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 inhibited yawning induced by low doses of apomorphine. The inhibitory effect of SKF 38393 on apomorphine-induced yawning was attenuated by pretreatment with specific D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 [2-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine-7-ol). On the other hand however, SKF 38393 potentiated sniffing induced by the high doses of apomorphine without affecting gnawing. These data indicate that D1 receptor activation modulates both pre- and postsynaptic effects of apomorphine in opposite directions.\n",

This study used decision analysis to evaluate approaches to testing for HIV infection in a variety of clinical situations.\n",
      "Methods: Four decision tree branches were evaluated to determine the relative importance of HIV seroprevalence, test sensitivity, test specificity, and other factors in four testing scenarios: 1) no HIV testing of anyone, 2) mandatory HIV testing for all health care workers and hospitalized patients younger than age 65, 3) testing of persons determined to be at high risk for HIV infection based on risk assessment, and 4) voluntary HIV testing and reporting.\n",
      "Results: No HIV testing results in a situation in which HIV status is unknown for all patients and health providers; issues of test sensitivity and specificity are not pertinent. Mandatory testing of health care workers and hospitalized patients, and testing only of high-risk persons, is heavily dependent on assumptions regarding HIV disease prevalence and on test sensitivity and specificity. Voluntary testing is more dependent on political decisions regarding the consequence of positive tests than it is on HIV prevalence or test characteristics.\n",
      "Conclusions: Policies regarding HIV testing are heavily dependent on the prevalence of HIV seropositivity, the sensitivity and specificity of HIV blood tests, and public policy.\n"

      "Frequent exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) place a considerable burden on the health care system and are a major cause of decreased health-related quality of life, accelerated pulmonary decline, and mortality in individual patients. Primary care physicians are usually the first point of contact for patients experiencing an exacerbation and are therefore best placed to prevent, identify, and treat these events in a timely manner. This review addresses the triggers and risk factors for COPD exacerbations, including the exacerbation-prone phenotype. The prevention, prompt diagnosis, and early appropriate pharmacological/nonpharmacological treatment of COPD exacerbations is important, as early recognition of symptoms (as supported by tools for measuring the illness/wellness experience of COPD patients in primary care) and treatment lead to optimal recovery in these patients. The review also highlights the importance of the urgency in identifying exacerbations and the important role played by primary care physicians in the prevention and postexacerbation management of patients with COPD.\n",

Detection of tetrahydrocannabinol and cocaine was more common in newborns of women of color, those receiving medical assistance, and those over age 23 years. Newborns with meconium samples positive for cocaine or tetrahydrocannabinol had slightly lower average birth weights but were no more likely to be premature or to require neonatal intensive care unit admission than newborns with no drugs detected in their meconium. Newborns of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy had lower average birth weights and higher rates of prematurity and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Standardized rates of cocaine detection in the four hospitals decreased from 4.0% in 1989 to 2.0% in 1993.\n",
      "Conclusions: Rates of perinatal cocaine detection have declined in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St Paul over the past 4 years. In this population, self-reported smoking was associated with more serious adverse outcomes of the newborns than was the detection of cocaine, marijuana, or opiates.\n",
      "Tourette's syndrome (TS), a chronic familial neuropsychiatric disorder of unknown etiology, is characterized clinically by the presence of motor and vocal tics that wax and wane in severity over the time and by the occurrence of a variety of neurobehavioral disorders. It is believed that the tics of TS result from increased dopamine (DA) activity caused by postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity. The synthesis and release of DA is regulated presynaptically by a specific class of DA D2 receptors, termed autoreceptors activation of which causes inhibition of DA synthesis and release. In experimental animals and humans administration of small doses of apomorphine, a DA D2 autoreceptor agonist, produces yawning. Recurrent episodes of yawning followed by increased motor tic activity was observed in two patients with TS during exposure to brief, extracranial applications of picotesla flux electromagnetic fields (EMFs). On the basis of these observations it is suggested that recurrent episodes of yawning in response to application of EMFs was induced by activation of presynaptic DA D2 autoreceptors while further exposure to these EMFs caused excessive stimulation of postsynaptic DA D2 receptors resulting in exacerbation of the tics. Thus, the dual effects of picotesla flux EMFs on the DA D2 autoreceptor and the postsynaptic receptor resemble the biphasic pharmacological and behavioral properties of apomorphine, a DA agonist which activates the autoreceptors in low doses while in higher doses causes stimulation of the postsynaptic receptors producing exacerbation of symptoms of TS. These findings demonstrate that picotesla flux EMFs applied extracerebrally may influence nigrostriatal DA transmission at pre- and postsynaptic DA D2 receptor sites.\n",
      "Purpose of review: Asthma is an important health problem in school-aged children and schools seem an obvious site to find and work with under-recognized and under-treated asthma. Teachers and coaches often must deal with asthma-related symptoms or emergencies requiring knowledge, skills, and written plans and policies. In 2005, school-based asthma work focused on two areas: identification of unrecognized asthma and management of under-treated asthma.\n",
      "Recent findings: Effective school-based screening requires a simple, effective screening tool. Three new asthma screening tools continue to identify more false-positive than true positive cases of asthma. Public health experts question whether asthma even fits the usual criteria for 'screening' because it does not have an asymptomatic phase. 'Case-finding' is presented as a better use of resources, allowing schools to focus on children with asthma that has been diagnosed but remains symptomatic. No school-based program based on letters, reminders, or recommendations sent to parents or community physicians changed asthma care. Three reports describe programs designed to supplement usual asthma care by providing in-school interventions, but none appeared ready for implementation in all schools in the USA. A major barrier was the continuing lack of school nurses, who must have asthma-related education and medical support to provide school-based asthma management.\n",
      "Summary: Schools continue to be a site for asthma interventions but few of the programs, even the most intensive, influence children's asthma-related health. Most programs require modifications and further evaluation, and all require careful assessment of the burden on schools.\n",
      "Objectives: To assess age-specific incidence rates, health care utilization, and lost parental work associated with varicella infection in a population-based cohort of children, and to validate parent-reported health care utilization data.\n",
      "Study design: We conducted a telephone survey of a population-based cohort of 4557 households with children aged birth to 13 years. Medical chart abstraction was used to validate health care utilization information.\n",
      "Results: We report varicella incidence rates in preschool children that are 2 to 2.5 times higher than previous studies. Rates of varicella-related serious complications, hospitalizations, parental work leave, and medication use are comparable with rates reported elsewhere. However, health provider visits occurred only 0.3 to 0.5 times as frequently as estimated in other studies. One hundred percent of reported hospitalizations and serious complications and 92% of provider visits were validated to be within the study time frame through medical chart audits.\n",
      "Conclusions: Parents are an accurate source of varicella-related health care utilization data. Parent-reported incidence data indicate that varicella infections are increasing in preschool children. This shift to infections in younger children may be related to the increased use of out-of-home care for infants and young children. Furthermore, the shift may after the community burden of varicella because of the observed increased parental work loss and decreased frequency of health care visits in the preschool children.\n"

      "The cost of autologous transfusions using semiautomated instruments in 52 orthopedic cases, 75 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) cases, and 218 aortic aneurysm cases was compared to the cost of equal amounts of homologous blood. While none of the orthopedic cases reached cost equivalence (median cost deficit per case, +97), 31 percent of the CABG cases (median cost deficit per case, +61) and 56 percent of the thoracic aortic aneurysm cases (mean cost surplus per case, +30) did so. In most cases, the major orthopedic and CABG procedures do not reach cost equivalence and might be served better by other means of autologous blood recovery. The more expensive semicontinuous flow devices are more cost-effective for higher-yield cases, such as major aortic aneurysm procedures.\n",
      "During voice evaluation and treatment it is customary for clinicians to elicit samples of the vowel /a/ from clients using various elicitation techniques. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of four commonly used stimulation tasks on the laryngeal mechanism. Eleven female singing students, studying at a university music school, served as subjects for the study. The subjects phonated the vowel /a/ using 4 vocal stimulation techniques: yawn-sigh, gentle onset, focus, and the use of the voiceless fricative. Videoendoscopic and acoustic evaluations of their productions were done. Results show that, in the first 100 ms following the end of the formant transition, these techniques affected voice differently. The fundamental frequency was found to be highest in the yawn-sigh condition, whereas the maximum frequency perturbation was obtained for the voiceless fricative condition. Planned comparisons were made by comparing the data across 2 dimensions: (1) vowels elicited with voiced contexts versus those elicited with voiceless consonantal contexts and (2) vowels elicited with obstruent versus vowels elicited with nonobstruent consonantal contexts. Some changes in acoustic parameters brought about by these stimulation techniques may be explained on the basis of coarticulatory effects of the consonantal context.\n",
      "We describe a patient with a left facial paralysis and hemotympanum following left parieto-occipital skull trauma. The initial admission diagnosis of intratemporal facial nerve injury secondary to temporal bone fracture was incorrect. Normal facial movements during involuntary activity (yawning, laughing at a joke) and focal seizure activity on the paralyzed side of the face, seen subsequently, indicated the site of lesion as supranuclear. The diagnosis of opercular syndrome was made. This syndrome can result when the contralateral frontal lobe is injured. Supranuclear weakness of muscles supplied by the hypoglossal or spinal accessory nerves is also present. Unlike other central paralyses, the facial paralysis in operculum syndrome may not demonstrate \"forehead sparing\" and consequently it may be mistaken for a peripheral paralysis. The neuroanatomic basis for the syndrome is discussed. Signs and symptoms are outlined to help the otolaryngologist avoid this diagnostic pitfall.\n",
      "Asthma is a variable disease, and various factors can lead to an increase (or decrease) in asthma symptoms and the level of asthma control. Pub Med was searched for recent articles dealing with asthma variability, environmental factors and co-morbid conditions that affect asthma control, and for publications which identified tools to facilitate patients' response to asthma variability. Variability in asthma symptoms may be a response to the individual's environment (e.g. seasonal variation, cigarette smoke, and air pollutants) or personal factors (e.g. inhaler technique, pregnancy, exercise). Co-morbid diseases such as allergic rhinitis may also impact significantly on asthma variability and control. Documenting asthma variability and assessing both adherence and possible triggers over time may allow patients and physicians to develop treatment programmes that anticipate, rather than follow, changes in the level of asthma symptoms. Personalised asthma control plans which take into account factors affecting symptom variability may enable patients to modify medication and their environment prophylactically in anticipation of a known trigger or at the first sign of an asthma exacerbation.\n",
      "In pigeons, peripheral injection of apomorphine HCl (1.5 mg) produced a rapid pecking response while intracerebroventricular administration of the drug (60 micrograms) was ineffective in this respect. Both peripheral and to a larger extent central treatment with apomorphine stimulated another activity, that is headshaking. The frequency of other behavioral patterns was either decreased (preening) or unaffected (yawning, stretching) following both treatments. Together with previous studies, these data suggest that (a) apomorphine stimulates pecking in pigeons by activating dopaminergic mechanisms lying in brain areas situated away from the ventricles; (b) dopaminergic mechanisms situated in periventricular regions may take part in the control of some patterns, e.g. headshaking, and (c) other activities do not appear to depend directly on these mechanisms.\n",

      "Objective: To evaluate the frequencies of fetal facial expressions in the third trimester of pregnancy, when fetal brain maturation and development are progressing in normal healthy fetuses.\n",
      "Methods: Four-dimensional (4 D) ultrasound was used to examine the facial expressions of 111 healthy fetuses between 30 and 40 weeks of gestation. The frequencies of seven facial expressions (mouthing, yawning, smiling, tongue expulsion, scowling, sucking, and blinking) during 15-minute recordings were assessed. The fetuses were further divided into three gestational age groups (25 fetuses at 30-31 weeks, 43 at 32-35 weeks, and 43 at ≥36 weeks). Comparison of facial expressions among the three gestational age groups was performed to determine their changes with advancing gestation.\n",
      "Results: Mouthing was the most frequent facial expression at 30-40 weeks of gestation, followed by blinking. Both facial expressions were significantly more frequent than the other expressions (p < .05). The frequency of yawning decreased with the gestational age after 30 weeks of gestation (p = .031). Other facial expressions did not change between 30 and 40 weeks. The frequency of yawning at 30-31 weeks was significantly higher than that at 36-40 weeks (p < .05). There were no significant differences in the other facial expressions among the three gestational age groups.\n",
      "Conclusions: Our results suggest that 4D ultrasound assessment of fetal facial expressions may be a useful modality for evaluating fetal brain maturation and development. The decreasing frequency of fetal yawning after 30 weeks of gestation may explain the emergence of distinct states of arousal.\n",

Management of petrous apex cholesterol granuloma has evolved in recent years from primary surgical treatment to conservative observation. In this article, a case of spontaneous resolution of a petrous apex cholesterol granuloma is described.

      "National and international guidelines for asthma recommend the assessment and documentation of severity as the basis for patient management. However, studies show that there are problems with application of the severity assessment to children in clinical practice. More recently, asthma control has been introduced as a method to assess the adequacy of current treatment and inform asthma management. In this article we review the application and limitations of the severity assessment and the asthma-control tools that have been tested for use in children. A system of using asthma severity for disease assessment in the absence of treatment and using asthma-control assessment to guide management decisions while a child is receiving treatment appears to be a promising approach to tailor treatment to improve care and outcomes for children with asthma.\n"

      "BACKGROUND Eagle syndrome is an unusual condition in which the styloid process (SP) becomes elongated and causes different clinical symptoms due to pressure on adjacent anatomical structures. The symptoms are non-specific and include severe throat, facial, and ear pain, or headaches. They are usually exacerbated by head rotation, swallowing, yawning, or chewing, but atypical presentations exist. It is a difficult pathology to diagnose and it can take several years before a proper diagnosis is made. CASE REPORT This report describes the case of a dental student presenting with an atypical presentation of Eagle syndrome. His styloid processes were 75 mm long and he was affected with severe pain to his throat, the anterior part of his ears, his submandibular area, and his molar teeth. The pain was exacerbated during maximal mouth opening, yawning, mandibular protrusion, and during downward head tilt, but not during the classically described movements of head rotation, swallowing, yawning, or chewing. Due to the absence of the classic symptoms, even with knowledge of the condition and unusual direct access to several oral and maxillofacial specialists, it took 4 years and multiple misdiagnoses to reach the final diagnosis. Following bilateral styloidectomy, all pain subsided. CONCLUSIONS The clinical presentation of Eagle syndrome varies, and the symptoms are non-specific. This greatly increases the complexity of diagnosing the condition and raises the time to diagnosis and the chances of misdiagnoses. It is, therefore, crucial to recognize the diagnostic tools, applicable imaging, and definitive treatment alternatives to successfully identify and treat patients affected.\n",
      "Eurycoma longifolia Jack commonly known as Tongkat Ali in Malaysia, has been used in Malaysia to increase male virility and sexual prowess. The objective of this study is to evaluate sexual arousal in sexually sluggish old male rats, 24 months old and retired breeders, receiving 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg of various fractions of E. longifolia Jack, twice daily, for 10 days. Control rats received 3 ml/kg of normal saline. The aphrodisiac effect was monitored by the act of yawning and stretching because yawning, either alone or associated with stretching, is considered an ancestral vestige surviving throughout evolution that promotes sexual arousal. The results showed that 800 mg/kg of E. longifolia Jack increased yawning by 50% and stretching by 16.7% in sexually sluggish old male rats, by 676-719% and 31-336%, respectively, in sexually active male rats, and by 22-44% and 75-100%, respectively, in middle aged, 9 months old and retired breeders. We conclude that the results of this study support the folk use of this plant as an aphrodisiac.\n",

      "Early changes in spontaneous behaviour (exploration, grooming, freezing, rearing, jaw motion, yawning) and body weight were measured at two and three days after pulp exposure injury and implantation of Fluorogold (FG) into molar teeth of rats. Rats with FG and injuries to three teeth gained weight less rapidly, explored less frequently and froze more often than sham-operated rats. Yawning was not observed in any rats prior to surgery and it was seen more frequently in tooth-injured rats than in sham-operated rats. These results suggest that careful observation of spontaneous behaviour after tooth injuries can be used to assess dental pain in rats and may provide behavioural markers to correlate with anatomical changes after injury. The dental nerve cell bodies that had accumulated transported FG were medium to large, and they only co-localized calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in a subset of the medium neurons. Chromatolytic or moribund FG-labelled neurons were also found.\n",
      "Objective: To assess the frequency of fetal facial expressions at 25-27 weeks of gestation using 4D ultrasound.\n",
      "Methods: Twenty-four normal fetuses were examined using 4D ultrasound. The face of each fetus was recorded continuously for 15 minutes. The frequencies of tongue expulsion, yawning, sucking, mouthing, blinking, scowling, and smiling were assessed and compared with those observed at 28-34 weeks of gestation in a previous study.\n",
      "Results: Mouthing was the most common facial expression at 25-27 weeks of gestation; the frequency of mouthing was significantly higher than that of the other 6 facial expressions (P<0.05). Yawning was significantly more frequent than the other facial expressions, apart from mouthing (P<0.05). The frequencies of yawning, smiling, tongue expulsion, sucking, and blinking differed significantly between 25-27 and 28-34 weeks (P<0.05).\n",
      "Conclusion: The results indicate that facial expressions can be used as an indicator of normal fetal neurologic development from the second to the third trimester. 4D ultrasound may be a valuable tool for assessing fetal neurobehavioral development during gestation.\n",

      "Diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary care is complex, as many clinical symptoms are similar to asthma and heart disease, which may lead to misdiagnosis and suboptimal disease management. Spirometry is the best method for diagnosing COPD and distinguishing between COPD, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases. Airway obstruction is fully reversible in asthma, but not in COPD, and can be confirmed when the postbronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) is <0.7. Knowledge of COPD treatment guidelines and a proactive attitude toward disease management by primary care physicians are key to improving symptom control and patients' quality of life. Identification of the appropriate drug/inhaler combination, patient education, training on inhaler use followed by regular monitoring, and pulmonary rehabilitation are also vital to successful COPD management. This review outlines steps to aid physicians in devising and implementing an optimal management plan for COPD patients.\n",

      "This study compares the prothrombin times (PTs) and calculated international normalized ratios (INRs) from first and second evacuation blood tubes to determine the clinical importance of using a second tube specimen for protime coagulation studies. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) currently recommends that all coagulation studies be done on a second or later drawn blood tube. For patients on long-term anticoagulation therapy, this often requires that first blood tubes be drawn and discarded at each prothrombin evaluation. In this prospective study, a first and second evacuation blood tube was drawn from 343 outpatients who had a physician-ordered prothrombin time test performed. There was no statistically significant difference in the paired PT or calculated INR from any of the first and second tubes. The average difference in the INR from tube 1 to tube 2 was 2% (standard deviation [SD] 1.1%). In this sample of outpatients, the use of a second tube for PT testing was not clinically justified.\n",

      "Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes can modulate dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and thereby modify the behavioral effects of drugs acting on DA systems. Insulin replacement, and in some conditions repeated treatment with amphetamine, can partially restore sensitivity of STZ-treated rats to dopaminergic drugs. The present study sought to characterize the role of insulin and amphetamine in modulating the behavioral effects of drugs that selectively act on D2/D3 receptors. In control rats, quinpirole and quinelorane produced yawning, whereas raclopride and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) produced catalepsy. Raclopride antagonized quinpirole- and quinelorane-induced yawning with similar potency. STZ treatment increased blood glucose concentration, decreased body weight, and markedly reduced sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning, quinelorane-induced yawning as well as to raclopride-induced catalepsy, while enhancing sensitivity to GHB-induced catalepsy. Repeated treatment with amphetamine partially restored sensitivity of STZ-treated rats to amphetamine-stimulated locomotion and also produced conditioned place preference, without affecting blood glucose and body weight changes. However, amphetamine treatment did not restore sensitivity to the behavioral effects of quinpirole, raclopride, or GHB, suggesting differential regulation of dopamine transporter activity and sensitivity of D2 receptors in hypoinsulinemic rats. Insulin replacement in STZ-treated rats normalized blood glucose and body weight changes and fully restored sensitivity to quinpirole-induced yawning, as well as to raclopride-induced catalepsy, while reducing sensitivity to GHB-induced catalepsy. Overall, these data indicate that changes in insulin status markedly affect sensitivity to the behavioral effects of dopaminergic drugs. The results underscore the importance of insulin in modulating DA neurotransmission; these effects might be especially relevant to understanding the co-morbidity of eating disorders and substance abuse.\n"

      "An international group of primary care asthma experts, as well as pulmonologists and allergists from Europe and the US, met to discuss asthma management focused on the primary care office. This paper summarizes their discussions. Accuracy of diagnosis and appropriateness of treatment is variable depending on the clinical circumstances and patient group. The value of classifying patients based on baseline or static asthma severity scores remains controversial, and asthma management decisions based on symptom control appear to have greater practical utility in a primary care setting. Furthermore, it must be recognized that patients, caregivers and physicians may have differing, and possibly conflicting, goals for therapy. There are many initiatives to improve the quality of asthma management, for example, primary care-focused guidelines being developed by the International Primary Care Respiratory Group, and several groups are working on asthma control scores. In addition, new therapies may improve the options available for increasing compliance and reducing side effects. In conclusion, asthma management should be patient-focused, with outcomes relevant to improving the quality of life for people with asthma.\n",
      "In order to investigate the influence of the route of administration on behavioural effects induced by apomorphine (APO), 6 increasing doses were administered by intraperitoneal and by subcutaneous route to male Wistar rats. Dose-response curves for stereotypy, rearing, sedation, grooming, yawning and penile erection were calculated. The occurrence of stereotypy precluded other behavioural manifestations. APO was more potent when administered subcutaneously, with potency ratios between the routes of 10.4 for stereotypy, 4.6 for sedation, 6.8 for grooming, 11.8 for yawning and 7.5 for penile erection.\n",
      "The behavioural responses induced in adult domestic pigeons by intraventricular injections of 0 to 6 IU of ACTH 1-39 are reported. The frequency of 10 different behaviour patterns was recorded for 90 min after administration of the peptide. The effect that was induced was complex, the frequency of some patterns increasing (yawning, headshaking, body shaking, wing-flapping), or some others decreasing (feeding, one-wing stretching, eye closing) or remaining unchanged (preening). The frequency of several patterns was maximal during the first 30 min following the injections but this was shown in some cases to be independent on the hormone administration.\n",
      "Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) carries high morbidity, mortality, and economic burden, which is even higher in adults diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While several studies have assessed the clinical burden and mortality risk of CAP and COPD, very few studies focus on CAP burden from a COPD patient perspective. Individuals recently diagnosed with CAP and with pre-existing COPD were recruited through the COPD Foundation. The CAP Burden of Illness Questionnaire (CAP-BIQ), a content validated questionnaire assessing CAP symptomatology, duration of symptoms and CAP impact on work, activities and family, was administered at baseline and at 30-days follow-up. Of the 490 participants recruited, 481 had data sufficient for analysis. The prevalence of respiratory-related symptoms was very high (>90%) at the time of diagnosis with other generalized symptoms such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, headaches and confusion present in more than 60% of participants. Mean duration of symptoms varied from approximately 2 weeks for headaches and fever to more than a month for fatigue, wheezing, dyspnea, and cough. Employed participants missed an average of 21 days of work and those not employed missed 36 days of usual activities. Over 84% required help from family, friends or care givers. CAP is a serious and burdensome condition for people with COPD, a condition that can impair activities for weeks, frequently requires care from family or friends, and includes lingering symptoms. The patient-reported impact of CAP reported in this study underscores the need for prevention strategies in this population.\n",

      "Methods: The authors compiled the data from all lower respiratory track(sputum) cultures collected from ambulatory patients who visited the Olmsted Medical Center and Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1998. Cultured organisms were identified, and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were presented and categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines for MIC and antibiotic susceptibility.\n",
      "Results: 4,297 potentially pathogenic organisms were obtained from sputum cultures for 1,921 patients. The most discernible changes in antibiotic resistance appeared to be in cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A trend toward increasing resistance of isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam drugs was observed in a portion of the population. An emerging intermediate susceptibility among isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudoumonas species was noted.\n",
      "Conclusions: Trends in antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens from ambulatory patients are less clear than those from hospitalized patients, but must be monitored because of the high percentage of ambulatory patients who receive empirical therapies. Trends in intermediate susceptibility patterns may help reveal emerging antimicrobial resistance.\n",
      "Health disparities and solutions are heterogeneous within and among racial and ethnic groups, yet existing administrative databases lack the granularity to reflect important sociocultural distinctions. We measured the efficacy of a natural-language-processing algorithm to identify a specific immigrant group. The algorithm demonstrated accuracy and precision in identifying Somali patients from the electronic medical records at a single institution. This technology holds promise to identify and track immigrants and refugees in the United States in local health care settings.\n",
      "Current treatments have failed to stem the continuing rise in health care resource use and fatalities associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Reduction of severity and prevention of new exacerbations are therefore important in disease management, especially for patients with frequent exacerbations. Acute exacerbation treatment includes short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics if bacterial infections are present. Oxygen and/or ventilatory support may be necessary for life-threatening conditions. Rising health care costs have provided added impetus to find novel therapeutic approaches in the primary care setting to prevent and rapidly treat exacerbations before hospitalization is required. Proactive interventions may include risk reduction measures (eg, smoking cessation and vaccinations) to reduce triggers and supplemental pulmonary rehabilitation to prevent or delay exacerbation recurrence. Long-term treatment strategies should include individualized management, addressing coexisting nonpulmonary conditions, and the use of maintenance pharmacotherapies, eg, long-acting bronchodilators as monotherapy or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids to reduce exacerbations. Self-management plans that help patients recognize their symptoms and promptly access treatments have the potential to prevent exacerbations from reaching the stage that requires hospitalization.\n",

      "Breastfeeding is highly beneficial to mothers and children. Yet even among women who intend to breastfeed their babies, it is not always initiated or sustained. We decided to examine whether cultural beliefs affect breastfeeding practices. Specifically, we looked at those of immigrant Mexican and Somali women who gave birth at a community hospital in southeastern Minnesota and those of the nurses and lactation educators who supported them. To study this, we conducted focus groups with health professionals (N=10) and in-person interviews with Somali and Mexican mothers (N=9). Although the mothers in this study stated their intention to breastfeed, our data show they faced significant challenges to early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, including their belief that they did not initially produce enough milk. We found the nurses' and lactation educators' discomfort with counseling people from another background as well as language differences and lack of cultural understanding were also barriers to early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding. This study highlights how the beliefs of new mothers and the attitudes of nurses and educators can affect breastfeeding outcomes.\n"

      "Context: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prevalent respiratory conditions with overlapping disease characteristics. Differentiation between asthma and COPD is important because several aspects of the guideline-recommended management strategies differ for these conditions. This review identifies the epidemiologic, etiologic, and clinical distinctions of these diseases to assist physicians and other clinicians in differentiating between asthma and COPD. Key components of the guideline-recommended management approaches for these conditions are also reviewed.\n",
      "Search strategies: Relevant articles were found by searching the MEDLINE database for \"asthma\" and \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease OR COPD\" in association with the terms \"diagnostic criteria\" and \"differential diagnosis\". Recent statistical summaries (meta-analyses), reviews, and consensus-type documents were also included.\n",
      "Synthesis: A review of relevant articles found that, although asthma and COPD may occur simultaneously, differences between these diseases are frequently recognized in terms of age at onset, prevalence in relation to age and sex, potential for reversibility of airway obstruction, pathophysiology, and typical symptom presentation. A thorough clinical history in conjunction with lung function testing usually aids in diagnostic distinction and choice of therapeutic interventions. Radiologic imaging and inflammatory marker testing may also aid in the differentiation of these conditions. Over time, disease progression often differs between asthma and COPD.\n",
      "Conclusions: Although overlaps exist in the disease characteristics of asthma and COPD, careful history, physical examination, and lung function testing often reveal information that facilitates distinction between these diseases, allowing physicians and other clinicians to better tailor their therapy.\n",

Data on its behaviour have been obtained by skin diving, SCUBA diving and observations in captivity. At Banyuls-sur-Mer Blennius rouxi lives at a depth of 1 to 42m. As an exception among Mediterranean blennies, Bl. rouxi feeds by grazing off the substrate. Algae, sponges and polychaetes (Sedentaria) are the main components of its food (HEYMER and ZANDER, in press). We could not confirm that the colouration, a white body with a conspicuous dark horizontal band, can be regarded as a signal of cleaning activity in statu nascendi. The male male have a spatial territory in which they occupy haptic holes. The female female lead a vagabond life and actively join the male male in their territories during the breeding season. Head nodding is an agonistic behaviour against other female female and has an attractive significance for spawning-motivated female female. The male male threaten with a widely opened mouth (threat yawning). Our data and observations on the ethology of Bl. rouxi are discussed and compared with those known of Bl. sphinx, Bl. incognitus, and Bl. zvonimiri, its nearest relatives.\n",
