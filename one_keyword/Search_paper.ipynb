      "Once central diabetes insipidus (CDI) has been diagnosed, every effort should be made to reveal its underlying cause. Autoimmune CDI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic CDI and also of mass lesions of the sella region. An autoimmune etiology of CDI was first suggested in 1983 by the detection of autoantibodies to hypothalamic vasopressin-producing cells (AVPcAb) in adults and also in children with the disease, using the indirect immunofluorescence test. The major autoantigen for autoimmune CDI has now been recognized as rabphilin-3A, a protein of secretory vesicles of the neurohypophyseal system. The detection of autoantibodies to rabphilin-3A by Western blotting or of AVPcAb provides strong evidence for the diagnosis of autoimmune CDI. Autoimmune CDI is recognized mostly in patients who had also been diagnosed with endocrine autoimmune disorders. The radiological and morphological correlate with autoimmune DI is lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LINH) as detected by magnetic resonance imaging and biopsies that show massive infiltration of the posterior pituitary and the infundibulum with lymphocytes and some plasma cells, and fibrosis in the later stages of the disease. LINH may be associated with lymphocytic anterior hypophysitis. Both may either appear spontaneously or on treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n",

      "Under physiological conditions, fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis is maintained by the kidney adjusting urine volume and composition according to body needs. Diabetes Insipidus is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome affecting water balance and characterized by constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. With respect to the similarly named Diabetes Mellitus, a disease already known in ancient Egypt, Greece and Asia, Diabetes Insipidus has been described several thousand years later. In 1670s Thomas Willis, noted the difference in taste of urine from polyuric subjects compared with healthy individuals and started the differentiation of Diabetes Mellitus from the more rare entity of Diabetes Insipidus. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank described polyuric patients excreting nonsaccharine urine and introduced the term of Diabetes Insipidus. An hystorical milestone was the in 1913, when Farini successfully used posterior pituitary extracts to treat Diabetes Insipidus. Until 1920s the available evidence indicated Diabetes Insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary gland. In the early 1928, De Lange first observed that some patients with Diabetes Insipidus did not respond to posterior pituitary extracts and subsequently Forssman and Waring in 1945 established that the kidney had a critical role for these forms of Diabetes Insipidus resistant to this treatment. In 1947 Williams and Henry introduced the term Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus for the congenital syndrome characterized by polyuria and renal concentrating defect resistant to vasopressin. In 1955, du Vigneaud received the 1955 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the first synthesis of the hormone vasopressin representing a milestone for the treatment of Central Diabetes Insipidus.\n",

The true prevalence is anticipated to be even higher because of the complexity of achieving a diagnosis in many patients who present with multisystemic complaints ranging from infancy to adulthood. Diabetes is a prominent feature of several of these disorders which might be overlooked by the endocrinologist.

      "Central diabetes insipidus is a rare disease of the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis. It is very unusually found in the adult with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is manifested by a polydipsic polyuric syndrome, which must be distinguished from the poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the similarity of both entities and the unusual nature of their coexistence, their suspicion is difficult. The case of a 72-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor insulin control (fasting hyperglycemia greater than 180 mg/dl) who had a long-standing polyuric syndrome is here presented. Hypernatremia and plasma osmolality elevated together with a low urinary osmolality led to the suspicion of diabetes insipidus, which was subsequently confirmed by the dehydration test and the administration of desmopressin sc. With 61% increase in the calculated urinary osmolarity one hour post desmopressin s.c., diabetes insipidus of central type was diagnosed. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance showed a bright spot with normal neurohypophysis, contributing to the diagnosis of the idiopathic form.\n",

      "Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare but devastating disorder of water balance with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Most patients develop the disease as a result of hypothalamic destruction from a variety of underlying etiologies. Damage to osmolar-responsive neuroreceptors, primarily within the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, results in impaired production and release of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Important regulating circuits of thirst sense and drive are regionally colocalized with AVP centers and therefore are also injured. Patients with central diabetes insipidus with impaired thirst response, defined as ADI, suffer from wide swings of plasma osmolality resulting in repeated hospitalization, numerous associated comorbidities, and significant mortality. Treatment recommendations are based largely on expert advice from case series owing to the rarity of disease prevalence. Acute disease management focuses on fixed dosing of antidiuretic hormone analogues and calculated prescriptions of obligate daily water intake. Long-term care requires patient/family education, frequent reassessment of clinical and biochemical parameters, as well as screening and treatment of comorbidities.\n",

      "Most of the central diabetes insipidus cases seen in general practice are acquired but the rare cases of hereditary autosomal dominant or recessive neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus have provided further cellular understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pre-hormone folding, maturation and release. Autosomal dominant central diabetes insipidus is secondary to the toxic accumulation of vasopressin mutants as fibrillar aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum of hypothalamic magnocellular neurons producing vasopressin. As well, Trpv1(-/-) and Trpv4(-/-) mice have shed new light on the perception of tonicity through the stretch receptors TRPVs expressed both in central and peripheral neurons. The genomic information provided by sequencing the AVP gene is key to the routine care of these patients and, as in other genetic diseases, reduces health costs and provides psychological benefits to patients and families. In addition, simple, inexpensive blood and urine measurements together with clinical characteristics and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could distinguish between central, nephrogenic and polydipsic cases.\n",

      "The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus involves the distinction between central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Differentiation is important because treatment strategies vary; the wrong treatment can be dangerous. Reliable differentiation is difficult especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. New diagnostic algorithms are based on the measurement of copeptin after osmotic stimulation by hypertonic saline infusion or after nonosmotic stimulation by arginine and have a higher diagnostic accuracy than the water deprivation test. Treatment involves correcting preexisting water deficits, but is different for central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia.\n",

      "Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) occurs secondary to deficient synthesis or secretion of arginine vasopressin peptide from the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS). It is characterized by polydipsia and polyuria (urine output >30mL/kg/day in adults and >2l/m2/24h in children) of dilute urine (<250mOsm/L). It can result from any pathology affecting one or more components of the HNS including the hypothalamic osmoreceptors, supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei, and median eminence of the hypothalamus, infundibulum, stalk or the posterior pituitary gland. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), and a dedicated pituitary or sella protocol is essential. CT can provide complimentary diagnostic information and is also of value when MRI is contraindicated. The most common causes are benign or malignant neoplasia of the HPA (25%), surgery (20%), and head trauma (16%). No cause is identified in up to 30% of cases, classified as idiopathic CDI. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the HNS is crucial when evaluating a patient with CDI. Establishing the etiology of CDI with MRI in combination with clinical and biochemical assessment facilitates appropriate targeted treatment. This chapter illustrates the wide variety of causes and imaging correlates of CDI on neuroimaging, discusses the optimal imaging protocols, and revises the detailed neuroanatomy required to interpret these studies.\n",

      "The hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a nonapeptide synthesized by hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei and secreted from the posterior pituitary into the bloodstream. It binds to AVP receptor 2 in the kidney to promote the insertion of aquaporin channels (AQP2) and antidiuretic responses. AVP secretion deficits produce central diabetes insipidus (CDI), while renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Hereditary and acquired forms of CDI and NDI generate hypotonic polyuria, polydipsia, hyperosmolality, and hypernatremia. The AVP mutant (Brattleboro) rat is the principal animal model of hereditary CDI, while neurohypophysectomy, pituitary stalk compression, hypophysectomy, and mediobasal hypothalamic lesions produce acquired CDI. In animals, hereditary NDI is mainly caused by mutations in AVP2R or AQP2 genes, while acquired NDI is most frequently induced by lithium. We report here on the determinants of the intake and excretion of water and mineral salts and on the different types of DI in humans. We then describe the hydromineral characteristics of these animal models and the responses observed after administration of hypertonic NaCl or when they are fed with low-sodium diets. Finally, we report on the effects of drugs such as AVP analogues and/or oxytocin, another neuropeptide that increases sodium excretion in animal models and humans with CDI, and sildenafil, a compound that increases the expression and function of AQP2 channels in animal models and humans with NDI.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a syndrome characterized by the persistent excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. It can be caused by any of four fundamentally different abnormalities: deficient production of the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP) by magnocellular neurons that form the posterior pituitary (hypothalamic DI); impaired renal effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI); reduced AVP secretion due to excessive water intake (primary polydipsia); or degradation of AVP by placental vasopressinase (gestational DI). Each type of DI can be caused or potentiated by other disorders. Hypothalamic and nephrogenic DI can also be caused by mutation of the gene that encodes the AVP prohormone, the AVP-2 receptors in the kidney, or the aquaporin-2 water channels that mediate antidiuresis. Familial hypothalamic DI is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode, but autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive forms also exist. Familial nephrogenic DI is usually transmitted in an X-linked recessive mode but can also be autosomal recessive or dominant. Hence the mode of inheritance does not always indicate the type of DI. Indirect methods of differential diagnosis are also unreliable and the pituitary MRI signal is diminished in both types of familial DI. Thus the determination of plasma AVP and/or the response to desmopressin therapy plus gene sequencing provides the best basis for effective management and family counseling.\n",

      "Central diabetes insipidus is a neuroendocrine disorder caused by disturbances in antidiuretic hormone release. The last one is responsible for fluid and electrolyte balance regulation. The most common cause of diabetes insipidus is resection of sellar-suprasellar tumors followed by damage to hypothalamic nuclei responsible for antidiuretic hormone release, disruption of antidiuretic hormone transportation from hypothalamus or its release by neurohypophysis. According to various data, postoperative diabetes insipidus occurs in 13-30% of cases. The highest risk of diabetes insipidus is observed after resection of craniopharyngioma, Rathke's cleft cyst and ACTH-releasing pituitary microadenoma. This review is devoted to prevalence and predictors of diabetes insipidus after resection of sellar-suprasellar tumors.\n",

      "Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a common complication after pituitary surgery. However, it is most frequently transient. It is defined by the excretion of an abnormally large volume of dilute urine with increasing serum osmolality. The reported incidence of CDI after pituitary surgery ranges from 0-90%. Large tumour size, gross total resection and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak usually pose an increased risk of CDI as observed with craniopharyngioma and Rathke's cleft cysts. CDI can be associated with high morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognised and treated on time. It is also essential to rule out other causes of postoperative polyuria to avoid unnecessary pharmacotherapy and iatrogenic hyponatremia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is established, close monitoring is required to evaluate the response to treatment and to determine whether the CDI is transient or permanent. This review outlines the evaluation and management of patients with CDI following pituitary and suprasellar tumour surgery to help recognise the diagnosis, consider the differential diagnosis, initiate therapeutic interventions and guide monitoring and long-term management.\n",

      "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine that results in polyuria and polydipsia, despite having normal or elevated plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). In this study, we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various etiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments. NDI has different clinical manifestations and approaches according to the etiology. Hereditary forms of NDI are mainly caused by mutations in the genes that encode key proteins in the AVP signaling pathway, while acquired causes are normally associated with specific drug exposure, especially lithium, and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary according to the degree of dehydration and hyperosmolality, being worse when renal water losses cannot be properly compensated by fluid intake. Regarding the diagnosis of NDI, it is important to consider the symptoms of the patient and the diagnostic tests, including the water deprivation test and the baseline plasma copeptin measurement, a stable surrogate biomarker of AVP release. Without proper treatment, patients may developcomplications leading to high morbidity and mortality, such as severe dehydration and hypernatremia. In that sense, the treatment of NDI consists in decreasing the urine output, while allowing appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia, and ensuring an acceptable quality of life. Therefore, therapeutic options include nonpharmacological interventions, including sufficient water intake and a low-sodium diet, and pharmacological treatment. The main medications used for NDI are thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and amiloride, used isolated or in combination.\n",

      "Objective: Lithium remains an important treatment for mood disorders but is associated with kidney disease. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is associated with up to 3-fold risk of incident chronic kidney disease among lithium users.

      "Polyuria-polydipsia syndrome consists of the three main entities: central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Reliable distinction between these diagnoses is essential as treatment differs substantially, with the wrong treatment potentially leading to serious complications. Past diagnostic measures using the classical water deprivation test had several pitfalls and clinicians were often left with uncertainity concerning the diagnosis. With the establishment of copeptin, a stable and reliable surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome has been newly evaluated. Whereas unstimulated basal copeptin measurement reliably diagnoses nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, two new tests using stimulated copeptin cutoff levels showed a high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. For the hypertonic saline infusion test, osmotic stimulation via the induction of hypernatraemia is used. This makes the test highly reliable and superior to the classical water deprivation test, but also requires close supervision and the availability of rapid sodium measurements to guarantee the safety of the test. Alternatively, arginine infusion can be used to stimulate copeptin release, opening the doors for an even shorter and safer diagnostic test. The test protocols of the two tests are provided and a new copeptin-based diagnostic algorithm is proposed to reliably differentiate between the different entities. Furthermore, the role of copeptin as a predictive marker for the development of diabetes insipidus following surgical procedures in the sellar region is described.\n",

Among the 22 patients with CNDI, 86.4% (19 cases) were male. The age of the 22 patients ranged from 2 months to 47 years old, in which 20 cases were younger than 30 years old and 2 cases were older than 30 years old. The clinical manifestations were polydipsia and polyuria, accompanied with various degrees of fever, defects in growth and development, and increased serum creatinine in some patients. Fifteen patients (68.2%) had different degrees of bilateral kidney and ureteral hydronephrosis, and increased residual urine volume in the bladder. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhanced scan showed that the high signal intensity in the posterior pituitary lobe was not detectable in 5 cases (22.7%), and blurred in 6 cases (27.3%). Seven tested patients were all found AVPR2 gene mutation. For patients with suspected CNDI, water-inhibiting vasopressin test and genetic testing should be performed in time so as to confirm diagnosis and treat as early as possible.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by polyuria and polydipsia that result from a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), central DI, or resistance to ADH, nephrogenic DI. In otherwise healthy patients with DI, normal thirst mechanism, and free access to water, the thirst system can maintain plasma osmolality in the near-normal range. However, in cases where DI presents with adipsia, cognitive impairment, or restricted access to water, true hypernatremia may occur, leading to severe morbidity and mortality. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 2-year-old boy who had global developmental delay and post-brain debulking surgery involving the hypothalamic region, which resulted in central DI and thirst center dysfunction. We describe the clinical presentation, the current understanding of adipsic DI, and a new practical approach for management. The main guidelines of treatment include (1) fixed desmopressin dosing that allows minimal urinary breakthroughs in-between the doses; (2) timely diaper weight-based replacement of water; (3) bodyweight-based fluid correction 2 times a day, and (4) providing the nutritional and water requirements in a way similar to any healthy child but at fixed time intervals. CONCLUSIONS This plan of management showed good effectiveness in controlling plasma sodium level and volume status of a child with adipsic DI without interfering with his average growth. This home treatment method is practical and readily available, provided that the family remains very adherent.\n",

      "\"Central diabetes insipidus Diabetes insipidus may remain undetected for a long time, the ionogram remaining normal as long as polydipsia compensates for diuresis. In the first place, and by argument of frequency, polyuria should rule out diabetes. Diabetes insipidus is evoked in the presence of an incapacitating polyuro polydipsic syndrome, especially at night. Pituitary MRI eliminate a tumoral or infiltrative cause and confirm a central cause by the disappearance of the physiological t1 hypersignal in the post-pituitary gland. A water restriction test should only be performed in a hospital setting under close supervision. Lifetime hormone replacement therapy is appropriate in situations of pregnancy, risk of dehydration, and signs of overdose must be known by the patient, who must be educated about his or her disease.\"\n",

      "Objective: To identify risk factors for the development of postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI) in a modern cohort of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery.\n",
      "Methods: Analysis of prospectively collected data of 449 consecutive patients operated on for anterior skull base pathology. DI was defined as a polyuria (> 250 ml/h for ≥ 2 consecutive hours) polydipsia syndrome associated with hypotonic urine with or without hypernatraemia. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of postoperative DI. A simple scoring system was then created.\n",
      "Results: Postoperative DI occurred in 46 (10.2%) patients. The development of DI did not affect quality of life. Predictors of DI on multivariate analysis included suprasellar extension (OR 2.2; p = 0.04), age < 50 years (OR 2.8; p = 0.003), craniopharyngioma histology (OR 6.7; p = 0.002), and Kelly grade 3 intraoperative CSF leak (OR 2.1; p = 0.04). The SALT score was created based on these characteristics, with one point awarded for each feature present, and predicted DI with fair to good predictive value in our cohort (AUROC 0.735 (95%CI 0.65-0.82)). The rates of postoperative DI were 4.0%, 6.5%, 15.0%. 36.8% and 85.7% for SALT scores of zero, one, two, three, and four, respectively.\n",
      "Conclusions: The SALT score predicts postoperative DI with fair to good accuracy, and now requires prospective external validation. Improved prediction of DI could optimize resource allocation and facilitate individualised preoperative patient counselling. We also provide our algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of DI.\n",

      "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a rare hereditary disease, characterized by a resistance of the renal collecting duct to the action of the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin, responsible for the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine. More than 90% of the patients are males and have the X-linked recessive form of the disease usually presenting with polyuria and polydipsia in infancy. This mode of inheritance is related to mutations in the V(2) receptor gene, located in the Xq28 chromosomal region. Less than 10% of the patients have an autosomal-recessive or an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance with clinical manifestations occurring in males and females, related to mutations in the aquaporin-2 gene, located in chromosome region 12q13. The aim of the treatment is to avoid chronic and acute dehydration episodes. It remains symptomatic, mainly based on an hypoosmotic diet and the use of hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin. Recent findings showed that pharmacological chaperones, such as V(2) nonpeptide antagonists, are able to rescue some of the V(2) receptor mutants and could be useful tools for treatment in the future.\n",

      "Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) is uncommon in the pediatric age group and rarely occurs in neonates. It should be suspected in any neonate presenting with excessive urine output and hypernatremia that persists despite increased fluid administration. Diabetes insipidus may be secondary to asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, infection, and structural abnormalities or may be idiopathic or genetic. Diagnosis includes a careful history, laboratory testing, and magnetic resonance imaging. Management of neonatal DI involves a careful balance between fluid intake and pharmacologic treatment. In this article we report a case of an extremely low birth weight infant presenting with central DI possibly caused by abnormality of the pituitary gland. Persistent hypernatremia was the initial presentation. Increased fluids were given initially but were only partially helpful. Eventually subcutaneous desmopressin (DDAVP) was required. The infant was unresponsive to intranasal DDAVP and required subcutaneous DDAVP upon discharge.\n",

      "Cranial diabetes insipidus (DI), which can cause life-threatening dehydration, is treated with desmopressin, often intranasally. This is challenging in patients whose nasal airflow is altered, such as those requiring tracheostomy. We report the case of a patient, taking intranasal desmopressin for cranial DI, who underwent partial glossectomy, free-flap reconstruction and tracheostomy. Postoperatively, she could not administer nasal desmopressin due to reduced nasal airflow. She developed uncontrollable thirst, polyuria and hypernatraemia. Symptoms were relieved by switching to an enteric formulation. A literature review showed no cases of patients with DI encountering difficulties following tracheostomy. The Royal Society of Endocrinology recommends perioperative planning for such patients, but gives no specific guidance on medication delivery in the context of altered airway anatomy. Careful perioperative planning is required for head and neck patients with DI, particularly for those undergoing airway alteration that may necessitate a change in the mode of delivery of critical medications.\n",

      "For most audiences, the term \"diabetes\" conjures thoughts of high levels of blood glucose and of the symptoms that characterize diabetes mellitus. In the last few years, a spirited campaign spear-headed by the families of affected individuals has made progress in educating nonprofessional and medical communities about diabetes insipidus (DI), the other disease characterized by polyuria (i.e., diabetes). Much work lies ahead to find better treatments for this affliction, but the progress in molecular biology over the last years made possible the identification of the genetic defects underlying the inherited forms of the disease. Numerous cases of adult-onset DI are triggered by toxic damage to the kidneys that impairs the concentrating capacity of the nephrons by a nonspecific mechanism. In these pages I shall deal mostly with the inherited forms of the disease. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys of affected individuals to produce concentrated urine (Morello and Bichet 2001). The elimination of large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia) are the chief symptoms of the disease. Although this condition and the hints that it was a hereditary disease were described at the end of the 19th century, it took almost 100 years to gain molecular knowledge about its etiology. A brief review of the important role played by vasopressin in the maintenance of body fluids will help the reader understand the severity of this disease.\n",

      "Background: Wolfram syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder, is considered the best prototype of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) diseases. Classical WS features are childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, neurological signs, and other abnormalities. Two causative genes (WFS1 and WFS2) have been identified. The transmission of the disease takes place in an autosomal recessive mode but autosomal dominant mutations responsible for WS-related disorders have been described. Prognosis is poor, death occurs at the median age of 39 years with a major cause represented by respiratory failure as a consequence of brain stem atrophy and neurodegeneration. The aim of this narrative review is to focus on etiology, pathogenesis and natural history of WS for an adequate patient management and for the discussion of future therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "Main body: WS requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to be successfully treated. A prompt diagnosis decreases morbidity and mortality through prevention and treatment of complications. Being a monogenic pathology, WS represents a perfect model to study the mechanisms of ER stress and how this condition leads to cell death, in comparison with other prevalent diseases in which multiple factors interact to produce the disease manifestations. WS is also an important disease prototype to identify drugs and molecules associated with ER homeostasis. Evidence indicates that specific metabolic diseases (type 1 and type 2 diabetes), neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammatory pathologies and also cancer are closely related to ER dysfunction.\n",
      "Conclusions: Therapeutic strategies in WS are based on drug repurposing (i.e., investigation of approved drugs for novel therapeutic indications) with the aim to stop the progression of the disease by reducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress. An extensive understanding of WS from pathophysiology to therapy is fundamental and more studies are necessary to better manage this devastating disease and guarantee the patients a better quality of life and longer life expectancy.\n",

      "Design: Blinded randomized controlled trial.\n",
      "Methods: Patients aged 18-65 operated for sellar-suprasellar tumours in an Indian tertiary care centre were enrolled through total enumeration sampling and underwent randomization with allocation concealment during Sep 2018-Feb 2019. Pre-operative DI, postoperative ventilation, renal failure or decompensated diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients in the intervention group received a nurse-led DI bundle (validated by three Delphi rounds) with four dietary components: intake of only water during thirst and avoidance of the following-added salt, high-protein foods and caffeinated drinks. Treating clinicians and the investigator assessing outcome were blinded about enrolment. Urine output, serum sodium, vasopressin requirement and hospital stay were assessed as primary outcomes. The outcome measures were monitored daily till the 6th postoperative day. Analyses were performed on 'intention-to-treat' basis, irrespective of compliance. Independent t-test and Chi-square test were used.\n",
      "Results: Of the initial 63 patients, 50 fulfilling criteria were randomized to two groups and assessed over six days yielding 150 patient-days per group. There were no significant baseline differences between groups. The mean daily urine output was significantly lower in the DI bundle group than in control, both overall and among endonasal operated pituitary adenomas [3000.09(462.7) vs. 4095.71(896.4)ml & 2987.14(419.5) vs. 4064.73(1051)ml], with the greatest difference on the second postoperative day. Though hypernatraemia in controls became most prominent during days 2-3 and resolved in a week, it was significantly lower in the intervention group (12.7% vs. 30.7% overall, 11.4% vs. 29.4% endonasal adenomas). The need for vasopressin analogues and hospital stay were also significantly lower with DI bundle (p < 0.001).\n",

      "BACKGROUND Hyponatremia is an electrolyte disorder frequently encountered by clinicians. Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary metastatic tumors should be considered as an alternative diagnosis when clinicians encounter patients with lung cancer who demonstrate hyponatremia. However, masked central diabetes insipidus should also be considered to prevent critical dehydration when glucocorticoid replacement therapy will be initiated. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia of 122 mmol/L. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a metastatic pituitary tumor and endocrinological examinations confirmed panhypopituitarism, including secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone replacement revealed masked diabetes insipidus with elevation of serum sodium levels that reached 151 mmol/L. Desmopressin administration was required to prevent water depletion and to immediately ameliorate the hypernatremia. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case report of masked diabetes insipidus that demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can mask the hypernatremia that is a typical manifestation of diabetes insipidus. Physicians should consider adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus due to pituitary metastasis of advanced malignancies, even when they encounter patients with hyponatremia.\n",

      "The contributions to our present knowledge and understanding of diabetes insipidus are briefly surveyed. Though a disease presenting with polyuria and thirst had been recognized since Antiquity, it was not until the 17. Century the distinction was made between diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. At the beginning of the 20. Century almost nothing was known about the function of the pituitary. It was generally believed that diabetes insipidus was a renal disease. Two clinical observations in 1912 suggested an association between the hypophysis and diabetes insipidus. This view was supported by the recognition in 1913 that extract of the posterior lobe of the pituitary was effective in diabetes insipidus. Despite much evidence to the contrary, it was assumed that the antidiuretic hormone was produced in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. Around 1950 it was finally established that 'the posterior lobe hormones' are in fact secreted in the hypothalamus. At the same time the antidiuretic hormone was isolated and synthesized. More recently, progress within genetics has made it possible to characterize in details other rare types of diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "Acquired forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) include lithium (Li)-induced and hypokalemia-induced NDI. Both forms are associated with AQP2 downregulation and collecting duct (CD) cellular remodeling. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs appearing to increase AQP2 membrane-translocation and improve urine concentration in other NDI models. We have investigated if statins are able to prevent or rescue the Li-induced changes in mice and in a mouse cortical CD cell line (mCCDc1l ). Biotinylation assays showed that acute (1hr) atorvastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin increased AQP2 membrane accumulation in mCCDc1l cells showing that the cell line responds to acute statin treatment. To see whether chronic statin treatment abolish the Li effects, mCCDc1l cells were treated with 48 h Li, combined Li/atorvastatin or combined Li/simvastatin. Li reduced AQP2, but combined Li/atorvastatin or Li/simvastatin did not prevent AQP2 downregulation. In mice, chronic (21 days) Li increased urine output and reduced urine osmolality, but combined Li/atorvastatin did not prevent these effects. In inner medulla (IM), Li reduced total AQP2 and increased pS261-AQP2. Combined Li/atorvastatin did not abolish these changes. Atorvastatin did not prevent a Li-induced increase in intercalated cells and proliferation in IM. In mice with already established NDI, atorvastatin had no effect on the Li-induced changes either. Mice subjected to 14 days of potassium-deficient diet developed polyuria and AQP2 downregulation in IM. Co-treatment with atorvastatin did not prevent this. In conclusion, atorvastatin does not appear to be able to prevent or rescue Li-NDI or to prevent hypokalemic-induced NDI.\n",

      "Methods: This is a prospective diagnostic study. Patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention of the sellar-suprasellar regions were recruited. Serum copeptin levels were measured before and after surgery, within 24 hours. Logistic regression analysis and diagnostic performance measures were calculated to determine the relationship between postoperative copeptin levels and DI.\n",
      "Results: Of 82 patients, 26 (31.7%) developed postoperative DI, with 7 patients (8.5%) having permanent DI. The samples for copeptin measurement were taken at 13 ± 2.1 hours postoperatively. From the receiver operating characteristic analysis, low postoperative copeptin levels (<2.5 pmol/L) demonstrated an acceptable ability to predict DI (area under the curve, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84). Discriminative power was stronger in the permanent DI group (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-1.00). Postoperative copeptin levels <2.5 pmol/L were associated with DI (specificity > 91%). However, postoperative copeptin levels >20 pmol/L were rarely associated with DI, with a negative predictive value of 100%.\n",

      "Ketamine is being prescribed with greater frequency due to an emphasis on multimodal analgesia. With increasing use, uncommon adverse effects associated with ketamine are likely to surface. Limited reports of transient central diabetes insipidus (DI) occurring early after initiation (ie, within 10 hours) of ketamine have been reported. We present 2 cases of delayed onset (32 hours or more after initiation), ketamine-induced, transient central DI in patients cannulated for venovenous extracorporeal membranous oxygenation. No other causes of central DI were determined based upon physical examination or laboratory data, and both patients responded to treatment with desmopressin/vasopressin. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale noted a probable causation for each case. These cases demonstrate the possibility of a rare but serious complication of ketamine. Improvement after discontinuation of ketamine and administration of desmopressin/vasopressin appear to support a drug-effect association.\n",

We describe a case of an elderly woman on chronic lithium therapy for bipolar affective disorder who initially presented with dehydration from vomiting but possibly developed extra-pontine myelinolysis (EPM) after over-zealous correction of hyponatraemia. Steroids administered appeared to have prevented further progression but a persisting hyperosmolar state then alerted us to the presence of nephrogenic DI. Although both conditions were later successfully reversed with no obvious chronic sequelae, the recovery of the patient was protracted.

      "Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare condition, with significant impact on patient health and well-being. It is a chronic condition which usually requires meticulous long-term care. It can affect both children and adults. There is limited literature considering the needs and challenges inherent in providing high quality care to patients with CDI, across the care pathway. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a unique and well-rounded understanding of clinical and healthcare systems-related challenges. It draws on insights from the literature, from direct clinical experience contributed by five clinicians as co-authors (providing insights from France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), and from patient perspectives provided through interviews with patient representatives from three patient organisations. We identify clinical challenges related to the diagnosis of CDI, including differentiating between other similar conditions and determining the underlying aetiology. Treatment is challenging, given the need to tailor medication to each patient's needs and ongoing management is required to ensure that patients continue to respond adequately to treatment. Ongoing support is required when patients switch between formulations. We also identify healthcare systems challenges related to limited awareness of CDI amongst primary care physicians and general paediatricians, and the need for highly skilled specialist care and appropriate workforce capacity. There is also a significant need for raising awareness and for the education of both healthcare professionals and patients about different aspects of CDI, with the aim of supporting improved care and effective patient engagement with healthcare professionals. We reflect on this information and highlight improvement opportunities. These relate to developing guidance to support patients, carers, primary care physicians and general paediatricians to identify clinical features earlier, and to consider CDI as a possible diagnosis when a patient presents with suggestive symptoms.\n",

Additionally, in comparison to the lithium group, the total histopathological score in the metformin group declined from 8.0 to 2.0 (p = 0.002).\n",
      "Conclusions: Metformin may help protect the kidneys from lithium-induced NDI through the AQP2 regulating effect and a reduction in oxidative stress.\n",

      "Background: Literature on diabetes insipidus (DI) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is scarce. Some studies have reported varying frequencies of DI and have showed its association with increased mortality, suggesting it as a marker of poor outcome. This knowledge gap in the acute care consequences of DI in severe TBI patients led us to conceive this study, aimed at identifying risk factors and quantifying the effect of DI on short-term functional outcomes and mortality.\n",
      "Methods: We assembled a historic cohort of adult patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary-care university hospital over a 6-year period. Basic demographic characteristics, clinical information, imaging findings, and laboratory results were collected. We used logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for the development of DI, and the association of this condition with death and unfavorable functional outcomes [modified Rankin scale (mRS)] at hospital discharge.\n",
      "Results: A total of 317 patients were included in the study. The frequency of DI was 14.82%, and it presented at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after ICU admission. Severity according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of the head, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and skull base fracture was suggested as risk factors for DI. Diagnosis of DI was independently associated death (OR 4.34, CI 95% 1.92-10.11, p = 0.0005) and unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 4-6) at discharge (OR 7.38; CI 95% 2.15-37.21, p = 0.0047).\n",
      "Conclusions: Diabetes insipidus is a frequent and early complication in patients with severe TBI in the ICU and is strongly associated with increased mortality and poor short-term outcomes. We provide clinically useful risk factors that will help detect DI early to improve prognosis and therapy of patients with severe TBI.\n",

      "Purpose: Diabetes insipidus (DI) develops commonly after endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (ETS). We retrospectively investigated the incidence, onset, duration and predictors of DI after ETS in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA).\n",
      "Methods: A total of 168 patients who underwent ETS to remove NFPAs were included. Various perioperative data on demographics, comorbidities, previous treatments, perioperative hormone deficiencies, tumor characteristics, surgery, anesthesia, intraoperative fluid balance, perioperative laboratory findings, postoperative complications, readmission and hospital length of stay were collected and analyzed. Patients were diagnosed with DI and treated with desmopressin when they showed urine output > 5 mL/kg/hr with a serum sodium concentration > 145 mmol/L or an increase ≥ 3 mmol/L in serum sodium concentration between two consecutive tests after surgery. DI was considered permanent when desmopressin was prescribed for > 6 months after surgery.\n",
      "Results: Seventy-seven (45.8%) patients experienced postoperative DI and 10 (6.0%) patients suffered from permanent DI. The median onset of DI and the median duration of transient DI were postoperative day 1 and 5 days, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, cephalocaudal tumor diameter (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.59 [1.05-6.36], P = 0.038) was related to postoperative DI. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, its area under the curve was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.76, P < 0.001). Its optimal cutoff value that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity for postoperative DI was 2.7 cm.\n",
      "Conclusions: Postoperative DI was observed in 45.8% of patients undergoing ETS to remove NFPAs. A large cephalocaudal tumor diameter was predictive of postoperative DI in such patients.\n",

      "Purpose: Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI), a rare disorder, which is clinically characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, results from mutations in the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene. The aim of this study was to perform functional analyses of three different mutations (p.G45C, 207_209delGGC, and p.G88V) defined in the AVP-NPII gene of patients diagnosed with FNDI, which are not included in the literature.\n",
      "Methods: For functional analysis studies, the relevant mutations were created using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment replacement strategy and expressed in Neuro2A cells. AVP secretion into the cell culture medium was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis. Fluorescence imaging studies were conducted to determine the differences in the intracellular trafficking of wild-type (WT) and mutant AVP-NPII precursors. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to determine the changing of the conformational properties of domains for both WT and 207-209delGGC mutant structures and dynamics behavior of residues.\n",
      "Results: Reduced levels of AVP in the supernatant culture medium of p.G45C and p.G88V transfected cells compared to 207_209delGGC and WT cells were found. Fluorescence imaging studies showed that a substantial portion of the mutant p.G45C and p.G88V AVP-NPII precursors appeared to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas 207_209delGGC and WT AVP-NPII precursors were distributed throughout the cytoplasm.\n",
      "Conclusions: The mutations p.G45C and p.G88V cause a failure in the intracellular trafficking of mutant AVP-NPII precursors. However, 207_209delGGC mutation does not result in impaired cellular trafficking, probably due to not having any significant effect in processes such as the proper folding, gain of three-dimensional structure, or processing. These results will provide valuable information for understanding the influence of mutations on the function of the AVP precursor hormone and cellular trafficking. Therefore, this study will contribute to elucidate the mechanisms of the molecular pathology of AVP-NPII mutations.\n",

      "Background: Disorders of water and sodium balance can occur after brain injury. Prolonged polyuria resulting from central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting complicated by gradient washout and a type of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, however, has not been described previously, to the best of our knowledge. We report an unusual case of an infant with glioblastoma who, after tumor resection, was treated for concurrent central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting complicated by secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "Case presentation: A 5-month-old Hispanic girl was found to have a large, hemorrhagic, suprasellar glioblastoma causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Prior to mass resection, she developed central diabetes insipidus. Postoperatively, she continued to have central diabetes insipidus and concurrent cerebral salt wasting soon after. She was managed with a vasopressin infusion, sodium supplementation, fludrocortisone, and urine output replacements. Despite resolution of her other major medical issues, she remained in the pediatric intensive care unit for continual and aggressive management of water and sodium derangements. Starting on postoperative day 18, her polyuria began increasing dramatically and did not abate with increasing vasopressin. Nephrology was consulted. Her blood urea nitrogen was undetectable during this time, and it was thought that she may have developed a depletion of inner medullary urea and osmotic gradient: a \"gradient washout.\" Supplemental dietary protein was added to her enteral nutrition, and her fluid intake was decreased. Within 4 days, her blood urea nitrogen increased, and her vasopressin and fluid replacement requirements significantly decreased. She was transitioned soon thereafter to subcutaneous desmopressin and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit.\n",
      "Conclusions: Gradient washout has not been widely reported in humans, although it has been observed in the mammalian kidneys after prolonged polyuria. Although not a problem with aquaporin protein expression or production, gradient washout causes a different type of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus because the absence of a medullary gradient impairs water reabsorption. We report a case of an infant who developed complex water and sodium imbalances after brain injury. Prolonged polyuria resulting from both water and solute diuresis with low enteral protein intake was thought to cause a urea gradient washout and secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The restriction of fluid replacements and supplementation of enteral protein appeared adequate to restore the renal osmotic gradient and efficacy of vasopressin.\n",

      "There are two forms of diabetes insipidus, central (neurohypophyseal), and nephrogenic, caused by pathogenic variants in the AVP gene and the AVPR2 or AQP2 genes, respectively. We report on a four-generation family, seven individuals had central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and the female index patient seen from age 16 to 26 years had (mild) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In her father with CDI, a known pathogenic heterozygous AVP variant c.232_234del p.(Glu78del) was identified, confirming the diagnosis of CDI in him and the other affected family members. In the proband, molecular analysis disclosed a novel heterozygous AVPR2 gene variant, c.962A > T p.(Asn321Ile) and an extremely skewed X-inactivation, confirming X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (XL-NDI). Whole exome sequencing showed no further causative mutation. This is the first report on the co-existence of CDI and NDI in one family. Our review of symptomatic female AVPR2 heterozygotes includes 23 families with at least one affected female (including this study). There were 21 different causative mutations. Mutation types in females did not differ from those in males. Both severe XL-NDI and mild forms were reported in females. All six females with severe XL-NDI had complete loss-of-function (null) mutations. The remaining 17 female probands had milder XL-NDI caused by 14 missense variants and three null variants of the AVPR2 gene. X-inactivation was studied in nine of these females; all showed extreme or slight skewing. The review underlines that XL-NDI in female AVPR2 heterozygotes is always accompanied by skewed X-inactivation, emphasizing a need for X-inactivation studies in these females.\n",

This is a transient syndrome and may be associated with acute fatty liver of pregnancy and preeclampsia. The use of dDAVP in symptomatic cases has been proven as a safe method for both the mother and the fetus during the pregnancy.

      "Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a complex disorder in which large volumes of dilute urine are excreted due to arginine-vasopressin deficiency, and it is caused by a variety of disorders affecting the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary network. The differential diagnosis is challenging and requires a detailed medical history, physical examination, biochemical approach, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Pituitary stalk size at presentation could be normal, but it may change over time, depending on the underlying condition, while other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid central nervous system damage and germ cell tumor dissemination and to minimize complications of multiple pituitary hormone defects. We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI and highlight several pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. The need for a careful and close follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may be recognized over time. The clinical scenario that we outline at the beginning of this article represents the basis for the discussion about how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked and demonstrates how a water intake and urine output improvement can be a sign of progressive damage of both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland with associated pituitary hormonal deficiencies.\n",

Caution is necessary for asymptomatic patients with pituitary metastases as invasive interventions, such as surgery, may induce pituitary dysfunction. Moreover, with respect to masked diabetes insipidus, there is a need to carefully consider pituitary dysfunction to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is an ancient disease considered under the rubric of diabetes, the Greek descriptive term for polyuria, which was unrecognized even after the sweetness of urine was reported as a characteristic of diabetes mellitus in the 17th century. It would be another century before diabetes insipidus was identified from the insipid rather than saccharine taste of urine in cases of polyuria. After its increased recognition, pathologic observations and experimental studies connected diabetes insipidus to the pituitary gland in the opening decades of the 20th century. Simultaneously, posterior pituitary lobe extracts were shown to be vasoconstrictive (vasopressin) and antidiuretic (antidiuretic hormone). As vasopressin was purified and synthesized and its assay became available, it was shown to be released in response to both osmotic and volume stimuli that are integrated in the hypothalamus, and vasopressin thereby was essential to maintaining internal water balance. The antidiuretic properties of vasopressin to treat the rare cases of diabetes insipidus were of limited clinical utility until its vasoconstrictive effects were resuscitated in the 1970s, with the consequent increasing wider use of vasopressin for the treatment of compromised hemodynamic states. In addition, the discovery of antidiuretic hormone receptor blockers has led to their increasing use in managing hypo-osmolar states.\n",

      "Purpose: Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) after cardiac arrest is not well described. Thus, we aim to study the occurrences, outcomes, and risk factors of CDI of survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\n",
      "Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed post-OHCA patients treated at a single center. Central diabetes insipidus was retrospectively defined by diagnostic criteria. One-month cerebral performance category (CPC) scores were collected for outcomes.\n",
      "Results: Of the 169 patients evaluated, 36 patients (21.3%) were diagnosed with CDI. All CDI patients had a poor neurologic outcome of either CPC 4 (13.9%) or CPC 5 (86.1%), and CDI was strongly associated with mortality. Age (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.99), respiratory arrest (OR, 6.62; 95% CI, 1.23-35.44), asphyxia (OR, 9.26; 95% CI, 2.17-34.61), and gray to white matter ratio on brain computed tomogram (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95) were associated with the development of CDI. The onset of CDI was earlier (P < .001) and the maximum 24-hour urine output was larger (P = .03) in patients with worst outcomes.\n",
      "Conclusions: All patients diagnosed with CDI had poor neurologic outcomes, and occurrence of CDI was associated with mortality. Central diabetes insipidus patients with death or brain death had earlier occurrence of CDI and more maximum urine output.\n",

      "A 49-year-old man developed severe hyponatremia associated with transient headache and was diagnosed with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Fluid restriction and sodium supplementation corrected the hyponatremia. However, several days later, the patient exhibited hypernatremia with thirst and polyuria. A detailed examination indicated central diabetes insipidus (CDI) with an intrasellar cystic lesion indicative of Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC). A case of RCC exhibiting headache, hyponatremia, and subsequent hypernatremia has been reported. Our case shows that CDI may appear after SIADH in patients with RCC, especially in those with serum sodium levels that unexpectedly increase rapidly beyond the reference range.\n",

      "Background: The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is challenging. The most reliable approaches are copeptin measurements after hypertonic saline infusion or arginine, which is a known growth hormone secretagogue but has recently also been shown to stimulate the neurohypophysis. Similar to arginine, glucagon stimulates growth hormone release, but its effect on the neurohypophysis is poorly studied.\n",
      "Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial including 22 healthy participants, 10 patients with central diabetes insipidus, and 10 patients with primary polydipsia at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.\n",
      "Methods: Each participant underwent the glucagon test (s.c. injection of 1 mg glucagon) and placebo test. The primary objective was to determine whether glucagon stimulates copeptin and to explore whether the copeptin response differentiates between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Copeptin levels were measured at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after injection.\n",
      "Results: In healthy participants, glucagon stimulated copeptin with a median increase of 7.56 (2.38; 28.03) pmol/L, while placebo had no effect (0.10 pmol/L (-0.70; 0.68); P < 0.001). In patients with diabetes insipidus, copeptin showed no relevant increase upon glucagon, with an increase of 0.55 (0.21; 1.65) pmol/L, whereas copeptin was stimulated in patients with primary polydipsia with an increase of 15.70 (5.99; 24.39) pmol/L. Using a copeptin cut-off level of 4.6pmol/L had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 100-100) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI: 70-100) to discriminate between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia.\n",
      "Conclusion: Glucagon stimulates the neurohypophysis, and glucagon-stimulated copeptin has the potential for a safe, novel, and precise test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "A few rare syndromes have been delineated in which diabetes mellitus is inherited in association with other conditions. This paper describes five patients, including four siblings in one family, who have diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness (the DIDMOAD syndrome). The parents of both families are normal but are first cousins. All the patients have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with a typical juvenile-onset. The onset of diabetes insipidus was insidious and the symptoms could easily have been ascribed to poor control of diabetes mellitus. The importance of diagnosing diabetes insipidus is that all these patients had dilatation of the urinary tract varying from mild hydroureter to severe hydronephrosis and this improved with treatment of the diabetes insipidus. It is suggested that patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy should have regular screening tests for diabetes insipidus since it is likely that they represent cases of the full syndrome with incomplete clinical expression. The occurrence of this rare syndrome in four siblings of unaffected parents indicates that the syndrome is due to a recessive gene, but the pathogenesis is unknown.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (MIM 222300) is the association of juvenile onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, also known as DIDMOAD (Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness). Patients present with diabetes mellitus followed by optic atrophy in the first decade, cranial diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness in the second decade, dilated renal outflow tracts early in the third decade, and multiple neurological abnormalities early in the fourth decade. Other abnormalities include primary gonadal atrophy. Death occurs prematurely, often from respiratory failure associated with brainstem atrophy. Most patients eventually develop all complications of this progressive, neurodegenerative disorder. The pathogenesis is unknown, but the prevalence is 1 in 770000 in the UK and inheritance is autosomal recessive. A Wolfram gene has recently been mapped to chromosome 4p16.1, but there is evidence for locus heterogeneity, and it is still possible that a minority of patients may harbour a mitochondrial genome deletion. The best available diagnostic criteria are juvenile onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, but there is a wide differential diagnosis which includes other causes of neurodegeneration.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WS), an infrequent cause of diabetes mellitus, derives its name from the physician who first reported the combination of juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. Also referred to as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness), it is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by various clinical manifestations, such as diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurological symptoms, renal tract abnormalities, psychiatric manifestations and gonadal disorders. The condition is very rare with an estimated prevalence of one in 770,000 of the normal population, one out of 150 cases of juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and with a carrier frequency of one in 354. This progressive neurodegenerative disease usually results in death before the age of 50 years and many patients lead a morbid life. The pathogenesis of the disorder although unknown is ascribed to mutation of a gene on chromosome 4p encoding a transmembrane protein of undetermined function called wolframin. This review summarizes the variable presentation of the disorder, its widespread complications, poor quality of life in affected individuals, and the problems in diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder also known as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). WFS seems to be a heterogeneous disease that has not yet been fully characterized in terms of clinical features and pathophysiological mechanisms because the number of patients in most series was small. In this study we describe 31 Lebanese WFS patients belonging to 17 families; this, to our knowledge, is the largest number of patients reported in one series so far. Criteria for diagnosis of WFS were the presence of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy unexplained by any other disease. Central diabetes insipidus was found in 87% of the patients, and sensorineural deafness confirmed by audiograms was present in 64.5%. Other less frequent features included neurological and psychiatric abnormalities, urodynamic abnormalities, limited joint motility, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in males, and diabetic microvascular disease. New features, not reported in previous descriptions, such as heart malformations and anterior pituitary dysfunction, were recognized in some of the patients and participated in the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Genetic analysis revealed WFS1 gene mutations in three families (23.5%), whereas no abnormalities were detected in mitochondrial DNA. In conclusion, WFS is a devastating disease for the patients and their families. More information about WFS will lead to a better understanding of this disease and hopefully to improvement in means of its prevention and treatment.\n",

      "A patient with severe idiopathic diabetes insipidus, complicated by diabetes mellitus, was first treated with a combination o clofibrate and chlorpropamide. Urine volume dropped from 18 litres/day (CH2O = 10.5 ml/min) to 3.1-5.1 litres/day (CH2O = -0.1 -+1.1 ml/min) under treatment. Ten months after the beginning of therapy treatment was maintained with chlorpropamide alone; no significant rise in urine volume was observed. After 18 months when therapy was stopped for 5 days urine volume rose to 11.7 litres/day maximum (CH2O = 6.6 ml/min). No obvious side effects occurred under treatment during a follow up for over 18 months. Serum levels for arginine vasopressin before and under treatment were below 1.0 pg/ml. Determination of free water clearance (CH2O) proved to be a highly sensitive and simple method for follow up controls. It is discussed whether the coincidental manifestation of diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus may be caused by a single molecular lesion. This hypothesis is supported by data which imply that in both disease chlorpropamide acts via a common molecular mechanism, the blocking of endogenous prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis. Finally a treatment with oral \"non-hormonal\" drugs like clofibrate and chlorpropamide should be taken into consideration in some cases of diabetes insipidus as is demonstrated by this case report.\n",

      "Seven patients with a rare syndrome of diabetes insipidus (DI), diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy (OA), neurosensory deafness (D), atony of the urinary tract, and other abnormalities (Wolfram or DIDMOAD syndrome) are reported. Of the seven patients, three siblings were followed up for 10-17 years. All seven patients had diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy; six had diabetes insipidus; and in the four patients investigated there was dilatation of the urinary tract. The severity of diabetes varied, and all required insulin for control of the hyperglycaemia. In one patient the course of the disease simulated maturity onset diabetes of the young; another presented with ketoacidosis; but none had haplotypes usually associated with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The diabetes insipidus responded to chlorpropamide, suggesting partial antidiuretic hormone deficiency. Onset of optic atrophy and loss of vision occurred relatively late and progressed slowly, although in one patient there was a rapid deterioration in visual acuity. Deafness was mild, of late onset, and of sensorineural origin. A degenerative process affecting the central and peripheral nervous system can explain all the manifestations of the syndrome except diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the diabetes mellitus remains obscure.\n",

      "Transcellular shifts of water and changes in the physiology of water excretion are common in diabetes mellitus and its treatment. Recent evidence indicates that hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, but not in normal subjects, is characterized by elevations of circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP; antidiuretic hormone, ADH). The role and importance of these observations remain to be defined since elevations of plasma AVP levels do not decrease water excretion in diabetic patients. Certain oral sulfonylureas, notably chlorpropamide and tolbutamide, are known to decrease renal free water clearance (CH2O), whereas insulin increases CH2O; the insulin and tolbutamide effects may be clinically trivial, whereas that of chlorpropamide is important. The hyponatremic effect of chlorpropamide may be exaggerated in diabetic patients by concomitant diuretic therapy. Euglycemia during chlorpropamide therapy appears to allow full expression of the action of chlorpropamide on CH2O; hyperglycemia with attendant osmotic diuresis protects chlorpropamide-treated patients against hyponatremia. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents enhances expression of the ADH effect on the kidney, but it does not appear to potentiate chlorpropamide hyponatremia. Two other oral sulfonylurea agents, tolazamide and glyburide, increase CH2O. Diazoxide is an antihypertensive thiazide which is antidiuretic as well as hyperglycemic. Thus, abnormalities of water metabolism are common in diabetes mellitus. Whether certain of these abnormalities are clinically important depends upon the presence of the osmotic diuresis of hyperglycemia and the pharmacology of diabetic management.\n",

      "The etiology of central diabetes insipidus (DI) is classified into (1) idiopathic, (2) familial, and (3) secondary. Of these, familial central diabetes insipidus shows an autosomal dominant inheritance. We herein report a case in which this disease was diagnosed based on a family history of nocturnal enuresis. A 40-year-old man had had symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria and nocturia since childhood and found that his daughter had the same symptoms. Despite reaching nine years old, his daughter's nocturnal enuresis still had not improved, resulting in her consulting a pediatrician. She was suspected of having familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) based on her family history and was referred along with her father for a detailed examination and treatment. A hypertonic saline load test (HSLT) to evaluate the arginine vasopressin (AVP) reaction was performed in both the proband and his daughter. The results showed no increase in AVP levels in response to high plasma osmolality. The water deprivation test (WDT) revealed he was suffering from partial DI. Based on the above findings and considering the possibility of familial central diabetes insipidus, we performed a gene mutation analysis of AVP-neurophysin II (NPII). Both the father and daughter had an exon 2 abnormality in this gene (c232_234delGAG; pGlu78del), and this gene mutation is known to cause NPII protein abnormality, abolishing the function of AVP as a carrier protein. This case was considered to have provided an opportunity to understand the role of an NPII gene abnormality in familial central diabetes insipidus.\n",

Here, we report a detailed case series, and evaluated the significance of anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies in differentiating the etiologies of CDI. A prospective analysis was conducted in 15 consecutive patients with CDI from 2013 to 2020 at a single referral center. Anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies were measured and the relationship between antibody positivity and the clinical/histopathological diagnoses was evaluated. Among 15 CDI patients, the positive anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies were found in 4 of 5 LINH cases, 3 of 4 lymphocytic panhypophysitis (LPH) cases, one of 2 sarcoidosis cases, and one intracranial germinoma case, respectively. Two Rathke cleft cyst cases and one craniopharyngioma case were negative. This is the first report of anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies positivity in CDI patients with biopsy-proven LPH.

Other signs such as the progressive sensorineural hearing loss, the presence of nystagmus and of urodynamic disturbances and renal complications makes the diagnosis of this syndrome easier.\n",

We describe a female patient with Wolfram syndrome diagnosed at the age of 25, with a previous false diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus and misdiagnosed diabetic complications. The patient was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations in exon 8 of WFS1 gene: a 2-bp deletion AT at nt 1539 leading to a frameshift (Y513fs) and a single-base substitution 1174C > T resulting in a stop codon (Q392X). A detailed analysis of the patient's medical history and a review of the literature suggest that many cases of Wolfram syndrome may remain undiagnosed due to misdiagnosis as type 1 diabetes mellitus and incorrect interpretation of clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative abnormalities, especially in their early stages.\n",

      "Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes are conditions characterized by the combination of two or more organ-specific disorders. The underestimation oftheir real frequency probable results from physicians' inadequate knowledge of these clinical entities and sometimes their atypical clinical presentation. Because they comprise a wide spectrum of autoimmune disorders, autoimmune polyglandular syndromes are divided into four types, among which type-3 is the most common one. In this article, we report the case of a young female, initially diagnosed with diabetes mellitus who several years later developed full-blown autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 consisting of autoimmune thyroid disorder and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.The discussed case suggests that in selected patients diabetes insipidus may coexist with autoimmune endocrinopathies and nonendocrine autoimmunopathies, as well as that in some patients idiopathic diabetes insipidus may be secondary to lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and/or the supraoptic-hypophyseal tract\n",

      "A 21-year-old Japanese man without known diabetes mellitus had abdominal pain. The diagnosis was ketoacidosis and hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis. He had polydipsia and polyuria and had habitually drunk several soft drinks every day for two years. After hospitalization, despite adequate liquid intake, dehydration remained with hypotonic polyuria. Further examinations revealed the coexistence of central diabetes insipidus (CDI), possibly caused by lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis, based on anti-rabphilin-3A antibody positivity. Although CDI had been undiagnosed for two years, over-consumption of sugar-rich soft drinks to ease thirst caused ketoacidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and acute pancreatitis. There are no previous reports of this three-part combination of symptoms caused by CDI.\n",

Patients that demonstrate diabetes mellitus are also affected by: optic atrophy in the first decade of their life, diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness in the second decade, and urinary tract and neurological abnormalities in the third decade of their life. Patients with Wolfram syndrome usually die due to central respiratory failures caused by brain stem atrophy in their third or at the beginning of their fourth decade of life.

      "Objective: Cytoplasmic autoantibodies to vasopressin cells (AVP) have been detected in patients with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus and only in one patient with endocrine autoimmune diseases without clinical diabetes insipidus. The aim of this study was to look for AVP cell antibodies (AVP-cell-Ab) in human sera of a large population of autoimmune endocrine disease patients without diabetes insipidus and to test whether an occurrence of these antibodies in some patients can be associated with partial impairment of posterior pituitary function.\n",
      "Measurement: Sera from 410 patients (310 females, 100 males, age range 10-46 years) with autoimmune endocrine disorders (260 with thyroid autoimmune disease, and 150 with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) without clinical diabetes insipidus, and from 100 normal subjects, were investigated for hypothalamic autoantibodies by an indirect immunofluorescence method. Positive sera were subsequently tested with specific rabbit anti AVP serum.\n",
      "Results: None of controls, but five out of 410 patients (1.2%) were AVP-cell-Ab positive. All positive and nine negative from the 410 screened patients were tested for posterior pituitary function. Two out of five AVP-cell-Ab positive patients showed partial diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "Conclusion: AVP cell antibodies can be shown in some patients with endocrine autoimmune disease without diabetes insipidus and can sometimes be associated with findings of partial posterior pituitary dysfunction. This suggests that clinical diabetes insipidus could be preceded by a long subclinical period characterized only by the occurrence of AVP-cell-Ab in the sera associated or followed by alterations in functional tests. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n",

      "Copeptin is a 39-amino-acids containing glycosylated peptide derived from the C-terminal part of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) precursor. In the process of proteolysis the AVP precursor is processed to AVP, neurophysin II, and copeptin in equimolar amounts. In contrast to AVP, copeptin remains stable for several days at room temperature in serum or plasma. Hence, copeptin serves as a bona fide biomarker of AVP release. We briefly summarise clinical utility of copeptin in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. We also discuss potential applications of copeptin measurements in hyponatraemic states, assessment of an anterior pituitary function, as well as a wide range of several acute and chronic medical conditions, such as myocardial infarction, stroke or diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "When a patient with diabetes mellitus presents with worsening polyuria and polydipsia, what is a sensible, cost-effective approach? We report the unique coincidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. A 46-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complained of polyuria with a daily output of 5 L. Although urinalysis demonstrated significant glucosuria, diabetes insipidus was suspected owing to a low urine specific gravity (1.008). The low specific gravity persisted during a water deprivation test. Ultimately, diabetes insipidus was confirmed when urine specific gravity and urine osmolality normalized following desmopressin administration. This case emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting the urine specific gravity in patients with polyuria and diabetes mellitus to detect diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "Methods: In total, 13 patients with suspected or clinically diagnosed Wolfram syndrome underwent ophthalmic and systemic examinations and genetic analyses for Wolfram syndrome between August and October 2018.\n",
      "Results: The mean age of the subjects was 24.2 ± 7.1 years, of which 5 (38.5%) subjects were male and 8 (61.5%) were female. The mean best-corrected visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to 20/40, with a mean of 20/250 (1.10 ± 0.69 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). Dyschromatopsia was present in all patients (100%). There was a severe decrease in the average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thicknesses (54.7 ± 6.5 and 51.9 ± 4.8 µm, respectively). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed significantly lower whole-image, inside disk, and peripapillary vessel densities in the patients with Wolfram syndrome than in the healthy controls (p < 0.001 for all). All patients who underwent genetic analyses had mutations in the WFS1 gene. Moreover, two novel mutations, p.Met623Trpfs*2 (c.1867delA) and p.Arg611Profs*9 (c.1832_11847del16) at exon 8, were detected. The frequency of systemic findings was as follows: optic atrophy (100%), diabetes mellitus (92.3%), central diabetes insipidus (38.5%), sensorineural hearing loss (38.5%), and presence of urological (30.8%), psychiatric (30.8%), and neurological (23.1%) diseases.\n",
      "Conclusion: Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can be associated with severe ophthalmic and systemic abnormalities. All patients who present with unexplained optic atrophy should be evaluated for Wolfram syndrome, even if they do not have diabetes mellitus because optic atrophy can sometimes manifest before diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Thirst and drinking are essential components of normal osmoregulation in healthy man. Abnormalities of thirst appreciation, in particular hypodipsia, have profound implications for water homeostasis. The combination of cranial diabetes insipidus and hypodipsia can have particularly serious consequences, with the potential for life-threatening hyponatraemia. Although the tools for measuring thirst are subjective and lack true specificity, their use in clinical research has contributed greatly to our understanding of the physiology of thirst appreciation and the abnormal control of thirst in osmoregulatory disorders. The precise neural control of thirst appreciation remains unknown, and perhaps as a result of this, satisfactory therapies for the treatment of disorders of thirst have not yet been developed; behavioural modification and retraining of drinking habits remain the rather limited cornerstones of management.\n",

The postmortem in one of our cases is mentioned. The pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The interpretation of the data on diabetes insipidus from the literature and in our three patients is also discussed. It can only be stated that neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus can be a component of the syndrome and that in many cases--particularly in the presence of lesions of the efferent urinary tract--the possibility of nephrogenous diabetes insipidus can not be excluded with certainty. It seems probable that the same mechanism can be held responsible for the lesions of the olfactory, optic, vestibular and cochlear nerves, the hypophyseal form of diabetes insipidus, retarded sexual maturation, abnormal pupillary reaction, myelopathy and the electro-encephalographic, electroneurological and electromyographic changes in the Wolfram syndrome.

      "After elective hospitalization, eleven healthy young women developed symptomatic hyponatremia that was rapidly followed by polyuria, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and death. The patients were 30 +/- 2 years old (+/- SE) with initial serum sodium of 140 +/- 1 mmol/L. They all awoke from analgesia but, 32 hours after completion of the procedure, they went from alertness to respiratory arrest in less than 1 hour. At this time, serum sodium was 116 +/- 2 mmol/L and blood glucose was 6.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/L. Without treatment for the hyponatremia, urine output spontaneously increased from 38 to 689 mL/h and urine osmolality fell from 546 to 83 mmol/kg body weight. Over the next 51 hours, blood glucose rose to a high of 24.1 +/- 2.5 mmol/L while serum sodium rose to a high of 167 +/- 2 mmol/L. None of the patients regained consciousness. At autopsy, all patients had cerebral edema with herniation along with hypoxic brain damage. The pituitary showed infarction of both anterior and posterior lobes in 7 of 7 patients examined, while 8 of 11 had necrosis of the medulla and 8 of 8 patients examined had hypothalamic necrosis. All had normal pancreas and kidneys at autopsy. Soon after respiratory arrest, all of the patients developed fixed, dilated pupils that often led to the diagnosis of brain death. Autopsy showed compression of the third cranial nerve (oculomotor) because of cerebral herniation. Thus, all of the patients were diagnosed as being brain dead when some may have been saved. These data suggest that in otherwise healthy young women, untreated symptomatic hyponatremia may lead to brain edema, cerebral herniation, and infarction of pituitary and hypothalamus, resulting in central diabetes insipidus and mellitus.\n",

The lesion is acquired during the pre-diuretic phase, owing to antidiuretic hormone resistance of the distal tubule as well as a severe concentrating defect. The diuretic phase after relief of obstruction can result in a massive, sustained and life-threatening diuresis. Sodium restriction and thiazide diuretics produce a mild volume contracted state, enhancing sodium and water reabsorption, primarily in the proximal tubule and possibly in the distal tubule owing to aldosterone. The recognition and differentiation of this unique pyloric syndrome from other more common post-obstructive diuretic states are important for all urologists who are responsible for the care of children.\n",

Intranasal DDAVP was discontinued after their discharge and both patients maintained normal urine output and appropriate urine osmolality. In determining whether diabetes insipidus is present in a patient who is polyuric and hypernatremic, a urine osmolality below that of the plasma suggests the presence of diabetes insipidus.

When compared with controls, all three models showed bladder mass, increased water consumption and urine output, higher mean and maximal increased micturition volumes, and greater bladder capacity and compliance by in vitro cystometry. The changes were more extensive in di/di rats than in the STZ and sucrose-drinking rats. The concentration of bladder collagen decreased in all three rat models when compared with controls. However, the collagen concentration of STZ bladders was significantly lower than the collagen concentration of di/di and sucrose bladders, suggesting that the decrease in bladder collagen concentration associated with experimental diabetes mellitus is only partly related to the increased diuresis. Contractile function was studied using a whole bladder model. Responses of whole bladders from control and diabetic rats to electrical field stimulation, carbachol and KCl were identical. Volume-pressure relations of the isolated whole bladder showed that the magnitude of the contractile response to KCl is constant at intravesical volumes ranging from about 10 to 95% of cytometrical bladder capacity. Bladders from Brattleboro di/di rats and STZ rats showed a rightward shift of volume-passive pressure curves when compared with appropriate controls. Bladders from sucrose-drinking rats had volume-passive pressure curves similar to the bladders from controls. This study suggests that while contractile function remains intact with increased diuresis, the passive function changes, with the bladder becoming more distensible.\n",

      "Diabetic nephropathy represents a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), and the origin of this complication is poorly understood. Vasopressin (VP), which is elevated in type I and type II DM, has been shown to increase glomerular filtration rate in normal rats and to contribute to progression of chronic renal failure in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. The present study was thus designed to evaluate whether VP contributes to the renal disorders of DM. Renal function was compared in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus (DI) lacking VP and in normal Long-Evans (LE) rats, with or without streptozotocin-induced DM. Blood and urine were collected after 2 and 4 weeks of DM, and creatinine clearance, urinary glucose and albumin excretion, and kidney weight were measured. Plasma glucose increased 3-fold in DM rats of both strains, but glucose excretion was approximately 40% lower in DI-DM than in LE-DM, suggesting less intense metabolic disorders. Creatinine clearance increased significantly in LE-DM (P < 0.01) but failed to increase in DI-DM. Urinary albumin excretion more than doubled in LE-DM but rose by only 34% in DI-DM rats (P < 0.05). Kidney hypertrophy was also less intense in DI-DM than in LE-DM (P < 0.001). These results suggest that VP plays a critical role in diabetic hyperfiltration and albuminuria induced by DM. This hormone thus seems to be an additional risk factor for diabetic nephropathy and, thus, a potential target for prevention and/or therapeutic intervention.\n",

      "Four Sudanese children with DIDMOAD syndrome (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness) are reported. They were two boys (aged 15 and 16 years) in one family and a boy and a girl (aged 16 and 6 years, respectively) in another family. Diabetes mellitus was first to appear (at 3-8 years) followed by deafness and visual failure; and the disease ended fatally in one patient (aged 20 years). In the other three, diabetes insipidus was confirmed using water deprivation test for 8 hours. The maximum urine osmolality ranged between 131-523 mOsm/kg, whereas the corresponding plasma osmolality ranged between 315-332 mOsm/kg. Slight further improvement in urine concentration was observed in 2 of the patients following the use of desmopressin (DDAVP, 20 micrograms intranasally). Intravenous pyelography, voiding cystourethrography and ultrasound revealed severe bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated ureters and distended bladder without vesicoureteral reflux in the three patients. With the high rate of consanguinity prevalent in North Africa and the Middle East, we recommend examining children who present with diabetes mellitus in this region for features of DIDMOAD syndrome.\n",

      "A 4-year-old boy was referred to the nephrologist with daytime urinary incontinence and suspicion of an overactive bladder. At the age of 17 months he had been referred to the pediatric endocrinologist because of polyuria and polydipsia in order to exclude diabetes insipidus. Repeated water deprivation tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were normal. Diabetes insipidus was excluded, and primary polydipsia was thought to be most likely since diabetes mellitus also had been excluded. At the current presentation, he drank up to 3 L a day and quite often had wet diapers. He also seemed to pass stools infrequently and with difficulty. Curiously his grandmother had similar symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia since childhood and had been diagnosed with primary polydipsia. The physical examination of our pediatric patient was normal. In the differential diagnosis we included diabetes insipidus but also contemplated other possibilities, such as nephronophthisis, tubulopathies and hypercalciuria. Laboratory results including urinalysis and an ultrasound of the kidney did not show any abnormalities, making a tubulopathy or hypercalciuria unlikely. A desmopressin test by the intravenous route came back completely normal, pointing to another cause than diabetes insipidus. Genetic testing for the nephronophthisis came back negative but was positive for a missense mutation in the AVPR2 gene (p.Arg104Cys) associated with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. He was started on daily desmopressin. Within 3 days the urinary incontinence resolved as did the polyuria and faecal incontinence. His grandmother was referred to the geneticist and eventually the adult nephrologist. This case highlights the importance of being thorough when confronted with a difficult diagnosis. It also emphasizes that a test result does not necessarily equate to the presence or absence of a condition since the test with 100 % sensitivity and specificity has yet to be discovered.\n",

      "The effects of water deprivation and the injection of deamino [8-D-arginine] vasopressin (dDAVP) on the metabolic activity of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial neurones of mice with inherited nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI +/+ Severe) have been investigated by quantitative autoradiography using the [14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) technique. The relative metabolic activities (rma) of the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) and pars nervosa (PN) in severely diabetic mice were not significantly different from the rma of the PVN and PN in Non-severe or Normal mice, but the rma of the pars distalis (PD) was greater in the Severe mice than in the other two strains. Water deprivation (4-5 h) significantly increased the rma of the PVN and PN in Severe mice compared with those in Non-severe mice that had been similarly deprived of water. The increased rma of the PVN and PN produced by water deprivation in Severe mice was not reduced to normal by injection of dDAVP. The injection of dDAVP alone had no effect on the rma of the PVN or PN, but dDAVP injection alone, water deprivation alone, or both treatments combined decreased the rma of the PD in Severe mice. Neither the supraoptic nuclei (SON) nor any of the other 19 brain areas studied were affected, in terms of rma, by either water deprivation, injection of dDAVP, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

      "Two pregnant women developed overt polyuria (up to 11 l/day) and polydipsia during their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In one patient hydronephrosis was present. Both patients suffered from mild gestational diabetes mellitus. Plasma sodium was 145 and 162 mmol/l. Polyuria and urinary hypo-osmolality responded well to desmopressin acetate. After delivery, polyuria and polydipsia disappeared in one patient and significantly improved in the other. Infusion of hypertonic saline one and two weeks respectively after delivery led to plasma hyper-osmolality (294 mosmol/kg and 305 mosmol/kg) without detectable stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Anterior pituitary function was normal. No stimulation of AVP occurred following insulin-induced hypoglycemia. AVP plasma disappearance after i.v. pulse injection of 1 microgram AVP as well as AVP plasma concentration after continuous infusion of 10 ng AVP/min was studied two weeks after delivery in one patient. The results suggested markedly elevated degradation of AVP compared to control subjects, probably due to an increased vasopressin activity. Eight months after delivery, hypertonic saline infusion in one patient led to a plasma-osmolality of 312 mosmol/kg without stimulation of AVP. In the second patient, AVP was not detectable (less than 0.2 pg/ml) six months after delivery when plasma osmolality was 290 mosmol/kg. Our studies demonstrate that a subclinical compensated diabetes insipidus was preexistent in both patients. Exacerbation occurred due to an increased AVP-clearance and presumably due to the hemodynamic and hormonal alterations during pregnancy, including a mild gestational diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional observational design. The sample consisted of 50 patients diagnosed with WS. Clinical criteria contributing to WS diagnosis were analyzed: diabetes mellitus (DM), optic nerve atrophy (OA), sensorineural deafness, urological and neurological dysfunction, among others. These parameters were assessed according to their presence/absence, age of onset, and various clinical-analytical parameters.\n",
      "Results: All the patients studied presented DM and OA, with a mean age of onset of 5.4 ± .9 (1-14) years and 9 ± .9 (1-16) years, respectively. The remaining criteria were present with a variable frequency: 77% had diabetes insipidus, 66.7% auditory alterations, 77.8% neurogenic bladder, 61.1% neurological involvement, and 27.8% hypogonadism. A 16.7% of the patients had positive albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g) and 72.2% had hyporreflexia. There were no significant differences in the age of diagnosis nor of the presence of different pathologies according to sex.\n",
      "Conclusions: The early presence of a non-autoimmune insulin dependent DM, should alert us of an \"infrequent\" diabetes syndrome. Wolfram's presumptive diagnosis could be established if juvenile-onset DM occurs concomitantly with OA, and this visual impairment is not attributable to diabetic retinopathy. Despite the long period of evolution of DM and altered values of HbA1c, the prevalence of microvascular complications in the sample are low.\n",

      "In a prospective study of abnormalities of plasma sodium concentration carried out over one year 20 patients were identified who had a concentration exceeding 154 mmol(mEq)/1. Of these, eight patients had diabetes mellitus, eight had primary intracranial disorder, and four had become dehydrated. Five of the eight diabetics presented with hyperosmolar, non-ketotic precoma, and in all eight hypernatraemia developed despite treatment with hypotonic (0.45%) saline. There was a good correlation (r = -0.93) between the rates of change of plasma sodium and blood glucose concentrations, and thus a rise in plasma sodium concentration appeared to be a consequence of the treatment. In the early phase of treatment urinary sodium loss was extremely low despite a brisk diuresis, the infused sodium then predisposing the patients to hypernatraemia. All of the eight patients with intracranial disorders showed evidence of abnormal production of the antidiuretic hormone, six having frank diabetes insipidus. Severe hypernatraemia in this group was associated with a high mortality, fluid balance being difficult to maintain. Two of the four patients who had become dehydrated had had a recent gastrointestinal haemorrhage. In these patients infusion of 0.9% saline contributed to the hypernatraemia since urinary sodium loss was low. Severe hypernatraemia in adults is uncommon, but in established cases plasma and urinary biochemical indices should be measured frequently. Monitoring of the central venous pressure is usually necessary, and patients are best managed in an intensive care unit.\n",

Medical records of 15 cats diagnosed with more than one endocrine disorder were reviewed. The majority of cats were domestic shorthairs, and the mean age at the time of diagnosis of the first disorder was 10.3 years. The most common combination of disorders was diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism. Two cats had concurrent diabetes mellitus and hyperadrenocorticism, one cat had concurrent central diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. A mean of 25.7 months elapsed between diagnoses of the first and second endocrine disorder, but this was variable.

Unusual features of this case were regional atrophy of the cerebellum and the pons, and hydrocephalus internus which were associated with alterations of personality and mental function. The clinical symptoms of the syndrome simulated \"essential\" type 1 diabetes with advanced complications such as retinopathy and autonomous and peripheral neuropathy. The presence of diabetes insipidus with polyuria and polydipsia was not recognized for years because the symptoms were ascribed to diabetes mellitus. The neurologic and psychological symptoms in this patient suggest a more generalized defect of the central nervous system in this syndrome than has been observed previously. Recognition of the condition is of importance because it requires specific therapeutic measures (e.g. for diabetes insipidus), and because of the genetic and prognostic implications.\n",

      "The paper is concerned with a case of a familial variant of the hereditary De Lawter syndrome, optic nerve atrophy coupled with diabetes mellitus and insipidus. Double diabetes was detected in two brothers. Their uncle suffered from deaf-mutism. Diabetes mellitus was insulin-dependent, diabetes insipidus responded well to adiurekrin, pituitrin, chloropropamide; optic nerve atrophy was characterized by white discs with clearly defined borders. Apparently, the syndrome is based on several mutant genes the action of which manifests as isolated and in different combinations as well.\n",

Type I diabetes mellitus, together with progressive optic atrophy and several other symptoms like deafness, diabetes insipidus and ectasy of urinary tract are known for more than 40 years as autosomal-recessively inherited conditions. Therefore, in case of diabetes mellitus combined with optic atrophy it is necessary to search for further symptoms, developing during the course of the disease.

      "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus usually presents with polyuria, polydipsia, fever, vomiting, dehydration and failure to thrive. However, in infancy polyuria may be absent because of dehydration and reduced glomerular filtration rate. In 2 cases the main presenting feature was hypotonia, with marked head lag. Family studies confirmed the X-linked mode of inheritance of the disease; in case 1 the disease appeared to have arisen as a new mutation in the mother, and in case 2 the carrier status was traced back to the great-grandmother. Pitfalls in the diagnosis and detection of the carriers are discussed. Treatment with thiazide diuretics and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors is effective in reducing urine volumes and polydipsia. The early detection of the disease and adequate management may prevent such complications as megacystis, mega-ureter and hydronephrosis, with resulting renal failure. Mental and physical retardation may also be avoided.\n",

      "Background: Biomarkers and target-specific phenotypes are important to targeted drug design and individualized medicine, thus constituting an important aspect of modern pharmaceutical research and development. More and more, the discovery of relevant biomarkers is aided by in silico techniques based on applying data mining and computational chemistry on large molecular databases. However, there is an even larger source of valuable information available that can potentially be tapped for such discoveries: repositories constituted by research documents.\n",
      "Results: This paper reports on a pilot experiment to discover potential novel biomarkers and phenotypes for diabetes and obesity by self-organized text mining of about 120,000 PubMed abstracts, public clinical trial summaries, and internal Merck research documents. These documents were directly analyzed by the InfoCodex semantic engine, without prior human manipulations such as parsing. Recall and precision against established, but different benchmarks lie in ranges up to 30% and 50% respectively. Retrieval of known entities missed by other traditional approaches could be demonstrated. Finally, the InfoCodex semantic engine was shown to discover new diabetes and obesity biomarkers and phenotypes. Amongst these were many interesting candidates with a high potential, although noticeable noise (uninteresting or obvious terms) was generated.\n",
      "Conclusions: The reported approach of employing autonomous self-organising semantic engines to aid biomarker discovery, supplemented by appropriate manual curation processes, shows promise and has potential to impact, conservatively, a faster alternative to vocabulary processes dependent on humans having to read and analyze all the texts. More optimistically, it could impact pharmaceutical research, for example to shorten time-to-market of novel drugs, or speed up early recognition of dead ends and adverse reactions.\n",

      "The finding of a polyuropolydispsic syndrome should prompt a complete biological investigation of its etiology. If polyuria can be a minor sign as in psychiatric disorder, it can also be the first manifestation of diabetes mellitus but also central diabetes insipidus, the latter linked to cerebral tumors, metastases in the hypothalamus, granulomatous disease, but also nephrogenic diabetes insipidus such as chronic renal disease or autoimmune disease. Intracellular dehydration is the major risk in case of a polyuropolydipsic syndrome. Prognosis depends on the capacity to maintain water balance through an intact thirst mechanism. After a brief review of the majority of causes of diabetes insipidus, we propose a diagnosis algorithm to easily make the diagnosis.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WS), also known as DIDMOAD (due to its association with diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness), is an infrequent cause of diabetes mellitus. This syndrome is included among the genetic disorders associated with diabetes in the American Diabetes Association's classification. WS is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by various clinical manifestations such as diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurological symptoms, renal tract abnormalities, psychiatric disorders and gonadal disorders. The most frequent of these disorders is early onset diabetes mellitus, with a low prevalence of ketoacidosis, and optic atrophy, which is considered a key diagnostic criterion in this syndrome. Diabetes insipidus usually develops later. This syndrome manifests in childhood, hampering diagnosis and treatment. Morbidity and mortality are high and quality of life is impaired due to neurological and urological complications. This article describes the clinical characteristics and outcome in three patients with WS. All three patients had antecedents of consanguinity. Genetic study was performed in all patients. One was homozygotic for the WFS1 gene that encodes the WFS1 G736A mutation in exon 8 and the remaining two patients, who were siblings, were homozygotic for the 425ins16 mutation in exon 4.\n",

Diabetes mellitus, diabetes inspidus, optic atrophy, deafness, myopia, and ventricular septal defect were observed in his elder brother. Juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, congenital glaucoma, deafness, and heart disease were the other remarkable findings observed in relatives to this family.

      "Insulin-dependent juvenile-onset diabetes may occur in the context of rare syndromic presentations suggesting monogenic inheritance rather than common multifactorial autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Here, we report the case of a Lebanese patient diagnosed with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes presenting ketoacidosis, early-onset retinopathy with optic atrophy, hearing loss, diabetes insipidus, epilepsy, and normal weight and stature, who later developed insulin resistance. Despite similarities with Wolfram syndrome, we excluded the WFS1 gene as responsible for this disease. Using combined linkage and candidate gene study, we selected ALMS1, responsible for Alström syndrome, as a candidate gene. We identified a novel splice mutation in intron 18 located 3 bp before the intron-exon junction (IVS18-3T>G), resulting in exon 19 skipping and consequent frameshift generating a truncated protein (V3958fs3964X). The clinical presentation of the patient significantly differed from typical Alström syndrome by the absence of truncal obesity and short stature, and by the presence of ketoacidotic insulin-dependent diabetes, optic atrophy and diabetes insipidus. Our observation broadens the clinical spectrum of Alström syndrome and suggests that ALMS1 mutations may be considered in patients who initially present with an acute onset of insulin-dependent diabetes.\n",

Diabetes mellitus usually occurs as the first manifestation of this syndrome, followed by the development of optic atrophy, neurosensory hearing loss, and finally diabetes insipidus. We report on four cases with a review of the literature. The diabetes mellitus occurring in these patients is clinically indistinguishable from classic type I diabetes mellitus. Two of three patients continue to have measurable C-peptide secretion 8 yr after onset of diabetes. Two of three patients with Wolfram syndrome had the HLA-DR2 antigen. Combining our cases with those described in the literature, 7 of 11 patients have the HLA-DR2 antigen. The preponderance of the HLA-DR2 antigen in the Wolfram syndrome is different from classic type I diabetes. This is further evidence of the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes mellitus. Although the Wolfram syndrome is rare, it should be considered in diabetic patients with unexplained optic atrophy and hearing loss or with polyuria and polydipsia in the presence of adequate blood sugar control.\n",

      "Five families were studied in which cranial diabetes insipidus occurred. In the pedigrees presented, the disease clearly followed an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkage analysis was performed in one large family by calculating lod scores for linkage between loci for cranial diabetes insipidus and 18 polymorphic markers and chromosome heteromorphisms. No significant genetic linkage was found and only one of the polymorphic markers gave a positive hint of linkage. A water deprivation test was performed in nine patients from three of the families and in healthy control subjects. The plasma concentration of arginine vasopressin was very low or undetectable in the patients, and unlike the control subjects did not increase significantly during water deprivation. Arginine vasopressin and serum osmolality (Sosm) were significantly positively correlated in the controls, but not in the patients. The results indicated that an arginine vasopressin-level lower than 2 pg/ml strongly suggests a diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus if at the same time Sosm is higher than 295 mosmol/kg. Studies with different intranasal dosages of 1-deamino-D-arginine-vasopressin (DDAVP) given once or twice a day showed that 20 micrograms effectively reduced urinary output and that administration once a day could be sufficient.\n",

Although indomethacin alone was without long-term effect, combined therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin regulated serum sodium better than hydrochlorothiazide alone.

      "A syndrome including juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, and high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, expressed completely or partially, is being identified with greater frequency. Visual loss may be progressive and accompanied by primary optic atrophy. Concurrent diabetic retinopathy has only rarely been reported. Visual acuity may deteriorate to less than 20/400. The etiology is unknown. However, histopathologic studies indicate that the diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy, and neurosensory hearing loss represent progressive degenerative conditions. Inheritance appears to be autosomal recessive with incomplete penetrance. The syndrome is rare; therefore, a complete neuroophthalmologic and neuroradiologic evaluation is imperative to rule out a mass lesion. This syndrome should be considered in young people with visual loss and optic atrophy of unknown etiology even if they are not known juvenile diabetics.\n",

      "Purpose: Wolfram syndrome is a degenerative, recessive rare disease with an onset in childhood. It is caused by mutations in WFS1 or CISD2 genes. More than 200 different variations in WFS1 have been described in patients with Wolfram syndrome, which complicates the establishment of clear genotype-phenotype correlation. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of WFS1 mutations and update the natural history of the disease.\n",
      "Methods: This study analyzed clinical and genetic data of 412 patients with Wolfram syndrome published in the last 15 years.\n",
      "Results: (i) 15% of published patients do not fulfill the current -inclusion criterion; (ii) genotypic prevalence differences may exist among countries; (iii) diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy might not be the first two clinical features in some patients; (iv) mutations are nonuniformly distributed in WFS1; (v) age at onset of diabetes mellitus, hearing defects, and diabetes insipidus may depend on the patient's genotypic class; and (vi) disease progression rate might depend on genotypic class.\n",
      "Conclusion: New genotype-phenotype correlations were established, disease progression rate for the general population and for the genotypic classes has been calculated, and new diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The conclusions raised could be important for patient management and counseling as well as for the development of treatments for Wolfram syndrome.\n",

All 3 patients had diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness and dilatation of the urinary tract. In 2 patients there was diabetes insipidus. The possibility of anatomical outlet obstruction or a neurogenic bladder was eliminated radiologically and urodynamically, and dilatation of the urinary tract was considered to be either a consequence of high diuresis associated with diabetes insipidus or a degenerative process affecting the central and peripheral nervous system, which can explain all of the manifestations of the syndrome except diabetes mellitus. A significant improvement in bilateral urinary tract distention was achieved by bladder drainage in the first 2 cases, while desmopressin therapy dramatically decreased the daily urinary output.\n",

Two sisters complained of progressive visual loss. Fundus examination evidenced optic atrophy. Their past medical history revealed diabetes mellitus and deafness since childhood. The association of these symptoms made the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome possible. It was confirmed by molecular analysis, which evidenced composite WFS1 heterozygous mutations inherited from both their mother and father.

      "Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease characterized by the failure to synthesize or secrete insulin, and diabetics are likely to suffer complications that include kidney and heart disease, as well as loss of sight, angiopathy, tissue hypoxia, reduction in organ blood flow, impaired wound healing, respiratory infections, arteriosclerosis, etc., thus diabetes very closely resembles a state of chronic hypoxia. It is now well recognized that hypoxia is an important environmental stimulus capable of modulating the expression of many genes involved in energy metabolism. The diabetic metabolic stress resulting from impaired energy metabolism, which produce altered production of inflammatory mediators, may increase the risk of oxidative injury. The aim was to investigate whether production of MIP-2 and MCP-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and if the regulatory effects of these chemokines are affected by hypoxia. Two groups of rats, diabetic and non-diabetic, were kept in normoxic room air conditions or subjected to chronic hypoxia. Expression and production of chemokines were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA assay. In diabetic rats, we found a marked increase of MCP-1 when compared with non-diabetic rats (783.5+/- 49 versus 461.9 +/- 27), while no significant differences were detected for MIP-2 levels. Hypoxia selectively modulated chemokines production, since MCP-1 expression and production was up-regulated in the diabetic groups (783.5+/- 49 versus 461.9+/- 27), but down-regulated MIP-2 expression and production (87.8+/- 23 versus 522.1+/- 72). Our data point to MCP-1 and MIP-2 as important components in the pathophysiology of diabetes, and hypoxia is an important and potent environmental stimulus capable of modulating the expression and production of these chemokines.\n",

      "Aim: Aims of the present paper are to ascertain WS prevalence and expression in a district of North-eastern Sicily, i.e. a geographic area where consanguineous unions are not very unusual.\n",
      "Materials and methods: Prevalence rates of WS in the Messina district were calculated by taking into consideration both the total population (653,737) and the populations included within the 0-30 year age range (202,681). We estimated the relative prevalence of WS among patients with youth-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) who are currently aged under 30 years (256).\n",
      "Results: Global WS prevalence in our district is 1:54,478, whereas prevalence among individuals under 30 is 1:16,890 and relative prevalence among patients with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent DM is 1:22.3. When compared with the patients with insulin-dependent DM of Messina district, WS patients did not exhibit significant differences in terms of biochemical features at DM onset, whereas age at DM diagnosis was significantly earlier in WS group.\n",
      "Conclusions: (a) WS prevalence is not so infrequent as generally expected; (b) in our series, DM presented before 10 years in 11/12 patients and ten cases have already developed all the four peculiar manifestations of WS by 26 years; (c) 9/12 patients exhibited a homozygous frameshift/truncation mutation (Y454_L459del_fsX454), which is the one most frequently found also in patients from other Italian regions; (d) age at DM diagnosis was significantly earlier in WS group than in the patients with insulin-dependent DM of Messina district.\n",

      "The excretion of cyclic AMP in urine has been examined in normal children and in children with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or moderate renal failure (predominantly defective concentrating ability) under basal conditions and in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). In contrast to other reported data, we could not confirm an ADH- and (PTH-unresponsiveness in hereditary, congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but our patients with structural renal disorders characterized by a defective urine concentrating ability did have reduced hormonal responses. It seems necessary to define nephrogenic diabetes insipidus very carefully, and until more data are collected, there appears to be no value in the measurement of urinary cyclic AMP level in the individual patient in the differential diagnosis of disorders due to renal concentrating defects.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WFS), also known as DIDMOAD, is an infrequent cause of diabetes mellitus. WFS is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by various clinical manifestations such as diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurological symptoms, renal tract abnormalities, psychiatric disorders, and gonadal disorders. The majority of patients with WFS carry the loss of function mutations in the WFS1 gene. The exons 2-8 of the WFS1 gene from one Chinese WFS patient were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), subcloning techniques and direct sequence determination was applied to the amplified fragments. The compound heterozygous mutation of a 3-bp (GAC) deletion (V434del) and another compound heterozygous mutation (G-->N)(W666X) in exon 8 of WFS1 gene was identified in the patient. Other seventeen members of her family were investigated. Four cases with heterozygotes had been found through screening for the mutation V434del and five cases for the mutation W666X in the whole family. This is the first report of WFS with the mutation V434del and W666X in the WFS1 gene.\n",

      "Methods: One case of WFS was reported. Combined with the clinical data of 8 cases of WFS which had been reported in China between 1994 and 2007, the clinical characteristics of WFS were reviewed.\n",
      "Results: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as the earliest manifestation was found in all of the 9 patients, with a median onset age of 5.0 years. Optic atrophy occurred in 8 patients (onset age: 8.5 years), diabetes insipidus in 7 patients (onset age: 8.5 years) and deafness in 7 patients (onset age: 9.8 years). Short stature was found in 6 patients and hydroureteronephrosis in 4 patients.\n",

Our patient has diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, abnormal audiograms, without subjective evidence of hearing loss, and dilatation of the urinary tract. Diagnosis was suspected at the age of 8 years. Diabetes mellitus was the first manifestation and treatment with insulin was necessary. Desmopressin therapy decreased dramatically the daily urinary output. In view of the significant morbidity and mortality from renal failure associated with recurrent urinary infections, we have drawn special attention to the urological manifestations of the syndrome. During the follow-up, the patients underwent some investigations, such as renal ultrasound and echotomography and cystourethroscopy. Outstanding results of these studies are severe bilateral hydronephrosis with dilatated ureters and loss of renal tissue. The particular finding is the presence of posterior urethral valves with obstructed bladder. The anatomical outlet obstruction are variable and may be disastrous. There may be failure to thrive, sepsis, anemia be disanal failure. In such instances corrective surgery could improve bladder and ureteral functions.\n",

      "Four organic small molecules belonging to the chemical groups of trimethylamines (betaine and glycerophosphorylcholine) and polyols (sorbitol and inositol) have been shown to act as organic osmolytes in the kidney. When measured along the corticopapillary axis, each exhibits a specific distribution pattern, indicating a specific localization and function. Studying their behaviour under vasopressin treatment in diabetes insipidus rats and after insulin treatment in diabetes mellitus rats confirmed this conclusion: AVP led to a steady increase of sorbitol and glycerophosphorylcholine over 7 days with no effect on inositol levels. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats, on the other hand, decreased sorbitol with a concomitant increase in glycerophosphorylcholine, again without any effect on tubular inositol concentrations. From this and in vitro studies it can be concluded that both hormones act by indirect mechanisms which alter interstitial osmolality. This in turn leads to a change in tubular osmolyte synthesis, uptake and release rates. In addition, the concentrations of the respective precursors glucose and choline influence the formation rates of sorbitol and betaine.\n",

Three of the patients appear to have had very gradual onset of diabetes mellitus at an early age yet all patients when tested for C-peptide response to glucagon were severely deficient. All patients are registered blind from primary optic atrophy, two have severe hearing difficulties and three high tone sensorineural hearing loss on audiometry. Four patients have cranial diabetes insipidus which in two cases is partial and of gradual onset and was attributed to poor control of the diabetes mellitus. In one case treatment of the insipidus relieved enuresis. All five patients have evidence of dilatation of the urinary tract and one patient is managed in the long-term by self-catheterisation which has resulted in one episode of bacteraemia. One patient has marked testicular atrophy and investigation reveals this to be due to primary hypogonadism and not to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. One female patient had her menarche delayed until the age of 19 years but has subsequently had the only successful pregnancy in a patient with this syndrome of which we are aware.\n",

At that time, an osteolytic lesion on the left temporal bone was localized by radiologic studies. A bone biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma. Laboratory tests also showed anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia and accelerated eritrosedimentation rate which constitute atypical manifestations of this rare disease in adults. The probable etiopathogenic mechanisms are discussed: while some authors have described an autoimmune primary defect, others have suggested a primary viral infection as the cause of Hand-Schuller-Christian disease.

ERG: distinctly reduced potentials. Audiogram: loss of high tones in the inner ear. Pediatric examination ruled out other endocrine disorders, no symptoms of diabetes insipidus were found.

      "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare complication of pregnancy. It is usually transient, being due to increased placental production of vasopressinase that inactivates circulating vasopressin. Gestational, transient DI occurs late in pregnancy and disappears few days after delivery. Acquired central DI can also occur during pregnancy, for example in a patient with hypophysitis or neuroinfundibulitis during late pregnancy or postpartum. Finally, pre-existing central or nephrogenic DI may occasionally be unmasked by pregnancy. Treatment with dDAVP (desmopressin, Minirin(®)) is very effective on transient DI of pregnancy and also on pre-existing or acquired central DI. Contrary to vasopressin, dDAVP is not degraded by vasopressinase. Nephrogenic DI is insensitive to dDAVP and is therefore more difficult to treat during pregnancy if fluid intake needs to be restricted.\n",

The polyuro-polydipsic syndrome was clinically well tolerated, without acute complications even during infancy. However, despite the lack of water restriction and the presence of thirst sensation, the children remained chronically hypernatremic. An intellectual deficiency was present, with a dysmorphic syndrome unrelated to a biochemically determined central nervous system disorder, or an X fragility. Calcifications of basal ganglia and frontal lobes were discovered on a cerebral computed tomography performed at 16 and 18 years. This syndrome may represent a specific entity.\n",

WS1 is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene located on chromosome 4p16 that encodes a transmembrane protein named wolframin. Many studies have shown that wolframin regulates some mechanisms of ER calcium homeostasis and therefore plays a role in cellular apoptosis. More than 200 mutations are responsible for WS1. However, abnormal phenotypes of WS with or without DM, inherited in an autosomal dominant mode and associated with one or more WFS1 mutations, have been found. Furthermore, recessive Wolfram-like disease without DM has been described. The prognosis of WS1 is poor, and the death occurs prematurely. Although there are no therapies that can slow or stop WS1, a careful clinical monitoring can help patients during the rapid progression of the disease, thus improving their quality of life. In this review, we describe natural history and etiology of WS1 and suggest criteria for a most pertinent approach to the diagnosis and clinical follow up. We also describe the hallmarks of new therapies for WS1.\n",

      "Purpose of review: Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS1) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness (DI DM OA D syndrome) associated with other variable clinical manifestations. The causative gene for WS1 (WFS1) encoding wolframin maps to chromosome 4p16.1. Wolframin has an important function in maintaining the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pancreatic β cells. Recently, another causative gene, CISD2, has been identified in patients with a type of Wolfram syndrome (WS2) resulting in early optic atrophy, diabetes mellitus, deafness, decreased lifespan, but not diabetes insipidus. The CISD2-encoded protein ERIS (endoplasmic reticulum intermembrane small protein) also localizes to ER, but does not interact directly with wolframin. ERIS maps to chromosome 4q22.\n",
      "Recent findings: Numerous studies have shown an interesting similarity between WFS1 and CISD2 genes. Experimental studies demonstrated that the Cisd2 knockout (Cisd2) mouse shows premature aging and typical symptoms of Wolfram syndrome. These researches provide interesting insight into the relation of neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondrial disorders, and autophagy and are useful for the pathophysiological understanding of both Wolfram syndrome and mitochondrial-mediated premature aging.\n",
      "Summary: The knowledge of WS1 and WS2 pathogenesis, and of the interactions between WFS1 and CISD2 genes, is useful for accurate diagnostic classification and for diagnosis of presymptomatic individuals.\n",

      "The neurophysins are the carriers of oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) along the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract. They are liberated when the hormones are released; their radioimmunoassay which are methodologically more simple than that of the active nonapeptides can be used in clinical practice. Moreover, the separate assay of each major neurophysins bring a specific index of the release of each hormone. The radioimmunoassay for circulating neurophysins appears to be useful for the differential diagnosis of polyuria, water retention and hypothalamic disease. The neurophysins are however devoided of any antidiuretic or oxytocic properties and their half-lives differ slightly from that of circulating hormones: therefore a basal level or values obtained in the course of an inhibitory test must be cautiously interpreted.\n",

      "The WOLFRAM syndrome (SW) is a rare hereditary disorder described for the first time in 1938 as the coexistence of a diabetes mellitus and an optic atrophy to which join frequently a diabetes insipidus and a bilateral deafness. Several genetic studies are current to determine transmission mechanisms, physiopathology of the disorder to update a curative therapy. On the occasion of a new case report we remind the main characteristics of this syndrome. The SW is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the coexistence of diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy and deafness. Several other manifestations are frequently associated: neurological, urologic and endocrinous abnormalities as well as growth troubles. Only diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are compulsory for the diagnosis. This Syndrome is transmitted to the autosomic recessive mode. Mitochondrial heredity is in the course of study. The systematic practice of a cerebral IRM during a SW allows finding several malformative abnormalities of which the most typical is the agenesis of the post-pituitary gland. The prognosis of the affection is essentially conditioned by the evoluting complications of the uropathy and the diabetes mellitus. The treatment is symptomatic. Genetic therapy is in.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. Diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness are also noted frequently, explaining the acronym DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness) by which the syndrome is also referred. Additional manifestations such as atonic bladder, ataxia, nystagmus and predisposition for psychiatric illness may be present. The Wolfram syndrome gene, WFS1, was mapped to chromosome 4p16.1 by positional cloning. It encodes an 890-amino-acid polypeptide named wolframin. Although the wolframin function is still not completely known, its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum suggests it can play a role in calcium homeostasis, membrane trafficking and protein processing. Knowing the cellular function of wolframin is necessary for understanding the pathophysiology of Wolfram syndrome. This knowledge may lead to development of therapies to prevent or reduce the outcomes of WS.\n",

      "We investigated the effect of central administration of angiotensin II (AngII) on a specific salt appetite (SSA) in homozygous diabetes insipidus Brattleboro (DI) rats because this stimulus induces such a response in all other rat strains. DI rats have a deficiency in the synthesis of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a reduced content of pituitary oxytocin (OT). They are characterized also by polyuria, polydipsia, and they seldom ingest high concentrations of NaCl solutions. We also tested if the appetite can be influenced by neurohypophyseal hormones especially oxytocin (OT) because it inhibits SSA in other animals. DI rats and Long Evans (LE) controls were fed ad libitum and given a choice between water, and either 0.9% or 1.8% NaCl. The data showed a significant increase of daily spontaneous water intake in DI compared with LE rats. Both DI and LE ingested similar small spontaneous volumes of the isotonic NaCl solution, but DI rats drank significantly less hypertonic NaCl than the LE controls. I.c.v infusion of AngII induced significant sodium intake in LE rats, but only raised water intake in DI rats. When combined with i.c.v. Ang II, OVT enhanced salt intake in LE animals while AVP attenuated water intake in both groups of rats and blocked NaCl intake completely in LE rats. In conclusion, DI rats did not demonstrate a SSA in response to central administration of AngII, although the drinking of water was enhanced. In combination with i.c.v. AngII, AVP inhibits water drinking in both DI and LE rats. In the LE controls OT attenuates AngII-induced SSA but has no effect in DI rats.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is a syndrome that associates both hypotonic polyuria and polydipsia, due to insufficient or ineffective arginine vasopressin (AVP) synthesis, or to AVP resistance. The diagnosis between central/renal origin, or an abnormal thirst regulation (primary polydipsia) is required to organize an adapted management. Because water deprivation tests are not reliable, it's often based on medical history, response to treatment and MRI. Copeptin is an AVP precursor which could be very helpful for the diagnosis. Its basal dosage may identify nephrogenic DI whereas osmotic stimulated dosage would discriminate central DI and primary polydipsia. Central DI is quite frequent after pituitary surgeries or traumatic brain injuries, and often transient. In case of early diagnosis and familial history of DI, a mutation of AVP gene is suspected, most of the time autosomal dominant. MRI is required to identify the other causes, i.e. tumors and inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, histiocytosis, hypophysitis). An advanced evaluation is required before idiopathic DI be retained, especially if a thickening of pituitary stalk is observed. The treatment of central DI is mainly based on lyophilisate of desmopressin administration.\n",

To answer this, multicenter retrospective analysis was performed.\n",
      "Methods: A questionnaire on clinical findings, histological diagnosis, and details of surgical procedures was sent to 86 neurosurgical and 35 pediatrics departments in Japan.\n",
      "Results: Fifty-one institutes reported 132 cases that fulfilled the 3 criteria. Tissue sampling was performed in 91 cases from pineal (n = 44), neurohypophyseal (n = 32), both (n = 6), and distant (n = 9) lesions. Histological diagnosis was established in 89 cases: pure germinoma or germinoma with syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells in 82 (92.1%) cases, germinoma and mature teratoma in 2 cases, and granulomatous inflammation in 2 cases. Histological diagnosis was not established in 2 cases. Although no tumors other than GCTs were identified, 3 (3.4%) patients had non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs). None of the patients developed permanent complications after endoscopic or stereotactic biopsy. Thirty-nine patients underwent simultaneous procedure for acute hydrocephalus without permanent complications, and hydrocephalus was controlled in 94.9% of them.\n",
      "Conclusion: All patients who fulfilled the 3 criteria had GCTs or granulomatous inflammation, but not other types of tumors. However, no fewer than 3.4% of the patients had NGGCTs. Considering the safety and the effects of simultaneous procedures for acute hydrocephalus, biopsy was recommended in such patients.\n",

However, these data were not conclusive because either observations were only anecdotic or did not match with control type 1 diabetic populations.\n",
      "Research design and methods: A group of 26 French diabetic patients with DIDMOAD was compared with a population of 52 patients with common type 1 diabetes matched for age at diabetes diagnosis (8.62 +/- 1.84 vs. 8.27 +/- 1.30 years; P = NS) and diabetes duration (12.88 +/- 1.58 vs. 12.87 +/- 1.13 years; P = NS) to study the quality of glycemic control and the incidence of microvascular complications.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin (AVP). Following the recent characterization of the cDNA and genomics sequences encoding the human V2 receptor to AVP (AVPR2), X-linked NDI has been found to be due to mutations in the AVPR2 gene that maps to the chromosome Xq28 region. To date more than 30 mutations, insertions or deletions have been reported in independent families, without any significant differences in the phenotypic expression of the disease. The AVPR2 is a member of the superfamily of 7 transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptor, linked to cyclic AMP second messenger system. Other types of inheritance have been described in NDI, and recently, a mutation of the aquaporin-2 gene, encoding a water channel of the renal collecting duct, has been reported in an autosomal recessive form of NDI.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is an uncommon condition characterized by polyuria and polydipsia. The symptoms and biochemical changes of this condition result from either a lack of antidiuretic hormone or renal insensitivity to its effect. Failure to produce or release antidiuretic hormone may result from cranial pathology, including trauma and surgery. The renal insensitivity to antidiuretic hormone that occurs in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may be caused by genetic factors, drugs (especially lithium) or specific disease processes. Patients may compensate for polyuria and nocturia by excessive water intake but show marked decreases in urine specific gravity and osmolality. Patients with severe and uncompensated symptoms develop marked dehydration, neurologic symptoms and encephalopathy. The water deprivation test is useful in diagnosing diabetes insipidus and in differentiating neurogenic from nephrogenic cases. Neurogenic diabetes insipidus may respond to nasal administration of desmopressin. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus requires good hydration and monitoring of body chemistry. Thiazides and amiloride may relieve symptoms.\n",

      "Objective: This work aims to determine the cause of a novel form of familial diabetes insipidus (DI) that is controlled by desmopressin therapy but segregates in an X-linked recessive manner.\n",
      "Methods: Thirteen members from 3 generations of the kindred with familial DI were studied. Water intake, urine volume, urine osmolality, plasma osmolality, and plasma vasopressin were measured under basal conditions, during fluid deprivation, 3% saline infusion, and water loading. Magnetic resonance images of the posterior pituitary also were obtained. In affected males, the effects of desmopressin therapy and linkage of the DI to markers for chromosome Xq28 were determined. In addition, the genes encoding vasopressin, aquaporin-2, the AVPR2 receptor, and its flanking regions were sequenced.\n",
      "Results: This study showed that 4 males from 3 generations of the kindred have DI that is due to a deficiency of vasopressin, is corrected by standard doses of desmopressin, and segregates with markers for the AVPR2 gene in Xq28. However, no mutations were found in AVPR2 or its highly conserved flanking regions. Exome sequencing confirmed these findings and also revealed no deleterious variants in the provasopressin and aquaporin-2 genes. The 4 obligate female carriers osmo-regulated vasopressin in the low normal range.\n",
      "Conclusion: X-linked recessive transmission of DI can be due to a defect in either the secretion or the action of vasopressin. Other criteria are necessary to differentiate and manage the 2 disorders correctly.\n",

We report, to our knowledge, the first case of Fournier's gangrene caused by C. ramosum in a female patient with multiple underlying conditions.\n",
      "Case presentation: A 44-year-old woman with a 6-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus after total pancreatectomy and an 11-year history of central diabetes insipidus developed a pain in the genital area after a month of urinary catheter use. The lower abdominal pain worsened gradually over 2 weeks, and the pain, general fatigue, and loss of appetite prompted the patient's hospital admission. As she had severe edema in her pelvic and bilateral femoral areas, ceftriaxone was started empirically after collecting two sets of blood cultures. On hospital day 2, CT examination revealed the presence of necrotizing faciitis in the genital and pelvic areas, and the antibiotics were changed to a combination of meropenem, vancomycin, and clindamycin. Gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods were isolated from blood cultures, which were finally identified as Streptococcus constellatus and C. ramosum using superoxide dismutase and 16S rDNA sequencing. An emergent surgery was performed on hospital day 2 to remove the affected tissue. Despite undergoing debridement and receiving combined antimicrobial chemotherapies, the patient's clinical improvement remained limited. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and she eventually died on hospital day 8. In the present case, the underlying diabetes mellitus, urinary incontinence due to central diabetes insipidus, undernutrition, and edema served as the predisposing conditions.\n",

Disruption of these finely balanced mechanisms is common, however, and can be precipitated by various disease states. Diabetes insipidus is a disease process with several underlying pathogenic mechanisms--all ultimately resulting in excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. This review will discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes insipidus, with emphasis on disorders of osmoregulation following neurosurgery of the pituitary and hypothalamus.\n",

      "The authors report on one case of Wolfram syndrome, a rare condition, which is characterized by juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy and sensorineural deafness. The findings of this 13-year follow-up show that this patient developed typical neurological complications of long-standing diabetes mellitus as in the common type 1 variant. Moreover, some peculiar signs occurred such as anosmia, ophthalmoplegia interna, and central nystagmus. Since Wolfram syndrome is probably part of a more generalized neurodegenerative disorder, long-term prognosis will depend both upon the severity of chronic diabetic complications and upon the rapidity, by which degeneration of cerebellar, pontine and brain stem structures appear. Prognosis of the cardinal clinical signs is such that optic atrophy, though usually quite rapid in the beginning, generally does not lead to complete blindness. Sensorineural hearing loss progresses very slowly so that deafness might be expected exceptionally only. The hearing deficit in classical diabetics, however, is of retrocochlear origin. Therefore, in Wolfram syndrome, a combined inner-ear and retrocochlear hearing loss may occur.\n",

      "We present two cases of hypercalcemic nephropathy associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Case 1 is a 37-year-old man who had repeated bone fractures and recurrent ureteral stones, which led to the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Case 2 is a 35-year-old man in whom parathyroid carcinoma was discovered because of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, resulting from severe hypercalcemia. Both patients developed mild renal dysfunction during the course of hyperparathyroidism. In the renal biopsy materials obtained from case 1, the renal interstitium showed chronic inflammatory changes. The tubules were partly damaged (focal necrosis). Deposition of calcium was sometimes noted within the mitochondria of the tubular epithelial cells. Some glomeruli showed glomerular sclerosis. In biopsy materials obtained from case 2 after resection of the carcinoma, similar histological features were observed, but tubular atrophy and necrosis were advanced. Polyuria and hypercalcemia were ameliorated after resection. These findings indicate that severe hypercalcemia might induce tubular dysfunction as well as organized changes.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome was originally described as a combination of familial juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. Other neurological features subsequently emerged, and \"DIDMOAD\" (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness) became a commonly accepted acronym. Here, we describe 4 further cases from 2 families, in whom there occurred previously unrecognized neurological features, central apnea and neurogenic upper airway collapse, together precipitating primary respiratory failure (fatal in 1 case), startle myoclonus (in 2 unrelated cases), axial rigidity, and Parinaud's syndrome. Magnetic resonance images revealed striking brainstem atrophy affecting, in particular, the pons and midbrain. The mitochondrial DNA from 3 cases (and relatives) showed no evidence of any of the previously reported abnormalities. These neurological and neuroradiological features, in conjunction with (1) analyses showing the neurodegenerative origin of optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, and incontinence, (2) other previously reported neurological complications (including anosmia, ataxia, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric and cognitive abnormalities), and (3) the very small number of published postmortem studies, indicate that Wolfram syndrome should be reemphasized as a unique hereditary neurodegenerative disorder with prominent optic atrophy and diabetes mellitus.\n",

      "Methods: This review examines the normal physiology of water homeostasis, the related changes that occur during pregnancy, and the pathophysiology of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy. Associated complications, evaluation, and management are discussed.\n",
      "Results: Diabetes insipidus can complicate up to 1 in 30,000 pregnancies. Diabetes insipidus during pregnancy has a variety of causes, some that predate the pregnancy and others that begin during gestation. Polyuria and polydipsia can occur or be exacerbated in women with overt or subclinical central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These women have either decreased central secretory reserve or impaired renal responsiveness to vasopressin. In addition, women can experience diabetes insipidus de novo in pregnancy through the actions of placental vasopressinase, which causes accelerated degradation of vasopressin. This form of diabetes insipidus may be associated with increased complications of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Management of central diabetes insipidus and transient diabetes insipidus of pregnancy can be achieved with 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin acetate) (DDAVP), a vasopressin analogue. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is typically resistant to both DDAVP and vasopressin and underlying causes should be addressed.\n",
      "Conclusions: Increased awareness of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy may lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment that will reduce the risks of maternal and fetal morbidity. Overall, growing experience with DDAVP has shown that it is a safe and effective treatment for diabetes insipidus caused by a variety of factors.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus, the inability to concentrate urine resulting in polyuria and polydipsia, can have different manifestations and management considerations in infants and children compared to adults. Central diabetes insipidus, secondary to lack of vasopressin production, is more common in children than is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the inability to respond appropriately to vasopressin. The goal of treatment in both forms of diabetes insipidus is to decrease urine output and thirst while allowing for appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia and ensuring an acceptable quality of life for each patient. An infant's obligate need to consume calories as liquid and the need for readjustment of medication dosing in growing children both present unique challenges for diabetes insipidus management in the pediatric population. Treatment modalities typically include vasopressin or thiazide diuretics. Special consideration must be given when managing diabetes insipidus in the adipsic patient, post-surgical patient, and in those undergoing chemotherapy or receiving medications that alter free water clearance.\n",

      "We report herein a 27-year-old male case of inherited distal renal tubular acidosis complicated with renal diabetes insipidus, the symptoms of which were aggravated by the occurrence of diabetes mellitus. At 2 months after birth, he was diagnosed as having inherited distal renal tubular acidosis and thereafter supplementation of both potassium and alkali was started to treat his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. At the age of 4 years, calcification of the bilateral renal medulla was detected by computed tomography. Subsequently his urinary volume gradually increased and polyuria of approximately 4 L/day persisted. At the age of 27 years, he became fond of sugar-sweetened drinks and also often forgot to take the medicine. He was admitted to our hospital due to polyuria of more than 10 L day, muscle weakness and gait disturbance. Laboratory tests disclosed worsening of both hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis in addition to severe hyperglycemia. It seemed likely that occurrence of diabetes mellitus and cessation of medications can induce osmotic diuresis and aggravate hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Consequently, severe dehydration, hypokalemia-induced damage of his urinary concentration ability and enhancement of the renin angiotensin system occurred and thereby possibly worsened his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. As normalization of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis might have exacerbated hypokalemia further, dehydration and hypokalemia were treated first. Following intensive treatment, these abnormalities were improved, but polyuria persisted. Elevated plasma antidiuretic hormone (12.0 pg/mL) and deficit of renal responses to antidiuretic hormone suggested that the polyuria was attributable to the preexisting renal diabetes insipidus possibly caused by bilateral renal medulla calcification. Thiazide diuretic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not effective for the treatment of diabetes insipidus in the present case.\n",

      "Results: The earliest manifestation of WFS was insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (at a median age of 6.9 y), followed by optic atrophy (8.9 y), diabetes insipidus (10.2 y) and deafness (10.5 y). Short stature was found in five cases, delayed puberty in two cases and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in one case. Audiography disclosed hearing loss at high frequency in all patients (100%), but only five patients had clinical subjective hearing problems. Intravenous pyelography revealed hydroureteronephrosis in eight patients. Urodynamics revealed a normal bladder in only one patient. Three patients had a low-capacity, low-compliance bladder, detrusor external sphincteric dyssynergia and emptying problem, while five had an atonic bladder. Ocular findings were optic atrophy, low visual acuity and colour vision defects. Visual field tests revealed concentric and/or peripheral diminution in five patients. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal (reduced amplitude to both flash and pattern stimulation) in seven patients. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed mild or moderate atrophy of the optic nerves, chiasm, cerebellum, basal ganglia and brainstem in six patients; there was a partially empty sella in one case. There was no evidence of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) (UUR) A to G (nucleotide 3243) mutation.\n",
      "Conclusion: Wolfram syndrome should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary manner. Some specific and dynamic tests are necessary to make a more precise estimate of the prevalence and median age of the components of WFS. Short stature is a common feature in WFS. Hypogonadism may be hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic. Bladder dysfunction does not always present as a large atonic bladder in WFS. A low-capacity, high-pressure bladder with sphincteric dyssynergia is also common.\n",

      "The management of patients with diabetes insipidus can be confusing because of the disorder's variable pathophysiology, the numerous medications used, and the possible complications related to their use. Nevertheless, the primary care physician, rather than the subspecialist, will increasingly be called on to manage patients with such relatively uncommon conditions in the future. If a few basic facts and principles are kept in mind, the care of most patients with diabetes insipidus can be successful. A comprehensive, practical review of the short- and long-term therapy for patients with diabetes insipidus, including central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and the \"excessive vasopressinase syndrome,\" is presented. The use of single and multidrug regimens, and of the newly marketed oral formulation of desmopressin acetate, is described for common clinical settings.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. It can be caused by any of 4 fundamentally different defects that must be distinguished for safe and effective management. They are: (1) pituitary DI, due to inadequate production and secretion of antidiuretic hormone, arginine-vasopressin (AVP); (2) gestational DI due to degradation of AVP by an enzyme made in placenta; (3) primary polydipsia, due to suppression of AVP secretion by excessive fluid intake; and (4) nephrogenic DI due to renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP. This review describes several methods of differential diagnosis, indicates the advantages and disadvantages of each and presents a new approach that is simpler and less costly but just as reliable as the best of the older methods. The various treatments for the different types of DI and recent findings on the genetic basis of the familial forms of DI are also discussed with emphasis on their contributions to improved diagnosis and management.\n",

      "Objective: Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare disorder consisting of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and a deficient or absent thirst response to hyperosmolality. Patients with ADI experience marked morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and management of these patients is quite challenging, even in expert hands. In this review, we aim to provide an updated overview of this difficult clinical scenario.\n",
      "Methods: We conducted a PubMed search for articles related to ADI. The search terms \"adipsia,\" \"adipsic,\" \"thirst,\" and \"diabetes insipidus\" were used to identify relevant literature.\n",
      "Results: ADI has been described in only approximately 100 patients. This rarity has limited the quality and quantity of literature to case reports, case series, and expert opinion. Diagnosis focuses on confirmation of CDI followed by documenting subnormal or completely absent thirst in response to a hypertonic stimulus. Among the described patients with ADI, the majority experience morbidity (e.g., severe hypernatremia, sleep apnea, venous thromboembolism [VTE], and obesity) and an increased mortality risk. Management focuses on frequent reassessment of daily prescribed water intake with fixed antidiuretic therapy (desmopressin) and comorbidity screening.\n",
      "Conclusion: The complexity of patients with ADI provides a difficult challenge for clinicians. Prompt recognition of thirst disorders in patients with CDI should lead to appropriately regimented management strategies and can result in safe outpatient care for these unique patients.\n",

      "Because of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) disorder on production or function we can observe dysnatremia. In the absence of production by posterior pituitary, central diabetes insipidus (DI) occurs with hypernatremia. There are hereditary autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X- linked forms. When ADH is secreted but there is an alteration on his receptor AVPR2, it is a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in acquired or hereditary form. We can make difference on AVP levels and/or on desmopressine response which is negative in nephrogenic forms. Hyponatremia occurs when there is an excess of ADH production: it is a euvolemic hypoosmolar hyponatremia. The most frequent etiology is SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH), a diagnostic of exclusion which is made after eliminating corticotropin deficiency and hypothyroidism. In case of brain injury the differential diagnosis of cerebral salt wasting (CSW) syndrome has to be discussed, because its treatment is perfusion of isotonic saline whereas in SIADH, the treatment consists in administration of hypertonic saline if hyponatremia is acute and/or severe. If not, fluid restriction demeclocycline or vaptans (antagonists of V2 receptors) can be used in some European countries. Four types of SIADH exist; 10 % of cases represent not SIADH but SIAD (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis) due to a constitutive activation of vasopressin receptor that produces water excess. c 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome or DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy as well as diabetes insipidus and deafness in many cases. We report the post-mortem neuropathologic findings of a patient with Wolfram syndrome and correlate them with his clinical presentation. In the hypothalamus, neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei were markedly decreased and minimal neurohypophyseal tissue remained in the pituitary. The pontine base and inferior olivary nucleus showed gross shrinkage and neuron loss, while the cerebellum was relatively unaffected. The visual system had moderate to marked loss of retinal ganglion neurons, commensurate loss of myelinated axons in the optic nerve, chiasm and tract, and neuron loss in the lateral geniculate nucleus but preservation of the primary visual cortex. The patient's inner ear showed loss of the organ of Corti in the basal turn of the cochleae and mild focal atrophy of the stria vascularis. These findings correlated well with the patient's high-frequency hearing loss. The pathologic findings correlated closely with the patient's clinical symptoms and further support the concept of Wolfram syndrome as a neurodegenerative disorder. Our findings extend prior neuropathologic reports of Wolfram syndrome by providing contributions to our understanding of eye, inner ear and olivopontine pathology in this disease.\n",

      "The immunolocalization of cathepsin L in the hypothalamus of normal rats was compared with the distribution of the enzyme in streptozotocin-treated animals and in vasopressin-deficient rats (Brattleboro strain). In rats with a normal metabolic status the neurons of magnocellular nucl. supraopticus and paraventricularis stood out by intense immunostaining for cathepsin L. In rats suffering from an experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and in homozygous Brattleboro rats we observed a strong reduction in enzyme immunoreactivity in these nuclei. Since cathepsin L is capable of splitting certain hypothalamic neuropeptides that are changed in diabetic animals, a role of the enzyme in the metabolism of these peptides is imaginable. Decrease in immunoreactive cathepsin L in vasopressin-deficient rats points to a possible involvement of the enzyme in the control of fluid homeostasis.\n",

      "Bladder function was investigated in female rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus (DI) and in healthy controls, in vivo by means of recordings of micturition pattern and cystometry, and in vitro in organ bath experiments. Rats with DI exhibited bladder hypertrophy, the weight of the bladder in these rats being two times that of controls. Recordings of micturition pattern showed that DI-rats had an increased 24 hour diuresis and micturition volume, and decreased micturition interval in comparison with controls. Cystometry recordings revealed increased bladder capacity and micturition volume in DI-rats. However, in these rats basal bladder pressure and threshold pressure were lower than in controls. No significant changes in micturition pressure or bladder compliance were observed, and none of the rats had residual urine. In organ bath studies, a lower maximal response to electrical field stimulation was obtained in bladder strips from DI-rats, than in the control strips, when expressed relative to the response elicited by K(+)-solution. When activated by field stimulation, the DI-bladder strips and the control strips had similar sensitivity to muscarinic receptor blockade with scopolamine at all stimulation frequencies. The sensitivity to carbachol was similar in the two groups. The results suggest that the increased functional demands of DI on the detrusor do not result in major changes pre- or postjunctionally. Further, several of the previously reported urinary bladder changes observed in rats with diabetes mellitus (DM) are similar to those now reported in rats with DI, emphasizing the importance of an increased diuresis per se for the development of alterations in bladder function. However, in contrast to the findings in DM rats, the sensitivity to electrical stimulation of nerves during blockade of muscarinic receptors was similar in DI-rats and their controls. This supports our previous suggestion that the increased resistance to muscarinic receptor blockade of the bladder in DM-rats at low stimulation frequencies is induced by the disease (diabetes mellitus) as such and not by the increased diuresis.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome(WFS: OMIM 222300) is a rare recessive neuro-endocrine degenerative disorder, known as DIDMOAD(Diabetes Insipidus, early-onset Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy and Deafness) syndrome. Most affected individuals carry recessive mutations in the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene(WFS1). The WFS1 protein is an endoplasmic reticulum(ER) embedded protein, which functions in ER calcium homeostasis and unfolded protein responses. Dysregulation of these cellular processes results in the development of ER stress, leading to apoptosis. In addition, abundantly present WFS1 protein in insulin secretory granules plays a role in the intra-granular acidification. However, the phenotypic pleiomorphism and molecular complexity of this disease limit the understanding of WFS. Here we review clinical features, molecular mechanisms and mutations of WFS1 gene that relate to this syndrome.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome 1 is a rare, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative, progressive disorder. Insulin-dependent, non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus and bilateral progressive optic atrophy are both sensitive and specific criteria for clinical diagnosis. The leading cause of death is central respiratory failure resulting from brainstem atrophy. We describe the clinical features of fourteen patients from seven different families followed in our Diabetes Center. The mean age at Wolfram syndrome 1 diagnosis was 12.4 years. Diabetes mellitus was the first clinical manifestation, in all patients. Sensorineural hearing impairment and central diabetes insipidus were present in 85.7% of patients. Other endocrine findings included hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (7.1%), hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (7.1%), and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (21.4%). Neuropsychiatric disorders were detected in 35.7% of patients, and urogenital tract abnormalities were present in 21.4%. Finally, heart diseases were found in 14.2% of patients. Eight patients (57.1%) died at the mean age of 27.3 years. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure which occurred in six patients. The remaining two died due to end-stage renal failure and myocardial infarction. Our data are superimposable with those reported in the literature in terms of mean age of onset, the clinical course of the disease, and causes of death. The frequency of deafness and diabetes insipidus was higher in our patients. The incidence of urogenital diseases was lower although it led to the death of one patient. Long-term follow-up studies including large patient cohorts are necessary to establish potential genotype-phenotype correlation in order to personalize the most suitable clinical approach for each patient.\n",

      "Micturition and bladder responsiveness in vitro were impaired in rats fed isotonic sucrose, afflicted with diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus. Their urinary output which was seven times control, initiated micturition responses at volumes three times control. Nerve-induced contractions by bladders from these rats developed substantially less pressure than control. Contractions elicited at 1 Hz by control and impaired bladders were potentiated equally by tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) (5 mM) or by carbachol (2 X 10(-7) M). Contractions elicited at 20 Hz by normal bladders were not potentiated, those by impaired bladders were. TEA, by increasing transmitter release, and carbachol, by a postjunctional action, substantially reversed bladder dysfunction. Because control and impaired bladders were equally enhanced by TEA, prejunctional and contractile element (CE) activity at 1 Hz were probably unaffected by distension. However, postjunctional sensitivity was probably reduced. Impaired bladders, more compliant than controls, became less compliant after carbachol without elevating resting pressure. Whereas the action of carbachol to enhance bladder responsiveness did not involve tension development, there may have been cholinoceptor facilitation and shortening of CE.\n",

Identically with the course of action after intravenous application the maximum of action as obtained after 1 to 2 hours, the duration of action depends on the dosage, in parenteral application of 1 microgram 18 to 24 hours, on an average 20 hours. According to the results demonstrated there are no references to a specific influence of the excretion of sodium, potassium and urea. The particular dynamics of the excretion rates of these substances, of the osmolarity clearance and the osmolarity of the urine is the sequel of the restitution of the renal concentration ability under the application of the antidiuretic hormone.\n",

      "Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is the end result of a number of conditions that affect the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system. The known causes include germinoma/craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases, trauma resulting from surgery or an accident, sarcoidosis, metastases and midline cerebral and cranial malformations. In rare cases, the underlying cause can be genetic defects in vasopressin synthesis that are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive traits. The diagnosis of the underlying condition is challenging and raises several concerns for patients and parents as it requires long-term follow-up. Proper etiological diagnosis can be achieved via a series of steps that start with clinical observations and then progress to more sophisticated tools. Specifically, MRI identification of pituitary hyperintensity in the posterior part of the sella, now considered a clear marker of neurohypophyseal functional integrity, together with the careful analysis of pituitary stalk shape and size, have provided the most striking findings contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of some forms of 'idiopathic' CDI. MRI STIR (short-inversion-time inversion recovery sequencing) is a promising technology for the early identification of LCH-dependent CDI.\n",

      "Background: Wolfram syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy (OA), central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and deafness (D). The phenotype of the disease has been associated with several mutations in the WFS1 gene, a nuclear gene localized on chromosome 4. Since the discovery of the association between WFS1 gene and Wolfram syndrome, more than 150 mutations have been identified in WS patients. We previously described the first case of perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome newborn carrying a segmental uniparental heterodysomy affecting the short arm of chromosome 4 responsible for a significant reduction in wolframin expression. Here we review and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that we believe responsible for the perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome as these data strongly suggest a role for WFS1 gene in foetal and neonatal neurodevelopment.\n",
      "Case presentation: We described a male patient of 30 weeks' gestation with intrauterine growth restriction and poly-hydramnios. During the first days of life, the patient showed a 19% weight loss associated with polyuria and hypernatremia. The presence of persistent hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L), high plasma osmolarity (322 mOsm/L) and low urine osmolarity (190 mOsm/l) with a Uosm/Posm ratio < 1 were consistent with CDI. The diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by the desmopressin test and the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 34 weeks of age, that showed the lack of posterior pituitary hyperintense signal. In addition, a bilateral asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia associated with right orbital bone hypoplasia was observed, suggesting the diagnosis of WF. During the five years follow-up the patient did not developed glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. By the end of the second year of life, primary non-autoimmune central hypothyroidism and mild neurodevelopment retardation were diagnosed.\n",
      "Conclusions: The analysis of our case, in the light of the most recent literature, suggests a possible role for WFS1 gene in the development of certain brain structures during the fetal period. Wolfram syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the rare cases of congenital central diabetes insipidus developed in the neonatal period.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WS) is mainly caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene and characterized by diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, hearing loss, and central diabetes insipidus (CDI). WFS1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein, and Wfs1 knockout (Wfs1-/-) mice, which have been used as a mouse model for WS, reportedly manifested impairment of glucose tolerance due to pancreatic β-cell loss. In the present study, we examined water balance, arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion, and ER stress in AVP neurons of the hypothalamus in Wfs1-/- mice. There were no differences in urine volumes between Wfs1-/- and wild-type mice with free access to water. Conversely, when mice were subjected to intermittent water deprivation (WD) for 20 weeks, during which water was unavailable for 2 days a week, urine volumes were larger in Wfs1-/- mice, accompanied by lower urine AVP concentrations and urine osmolality, compared to wild-type mice. The mRNA expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, a marker of ER stress, was significantly increased in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nuclei in Wfs1-/- mice compared to wild-type mice after WD. Our results thus showed that Wfs1 knockout leads to a decrease in AVP secretion during dehydration, which could explain in part the mechanisms by which Wfs1 mutations cause CDI in humans.\n",

      "Normal water balance with strict maintenance of plasma osmolality depends on appropriate water conservation (controlled by ADH release and action) and additional water intake if required (triggered by the awareness of thirst). Central nervous system pathology (including trauma) commonly involves the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk, leading to impaired osmoreceptor function or diminished ADH production or release, resulting in diabetes insipidus (with potentially life-threatening abnormalities in fluid and electrolyte status). Assessment of the relationships between plasma and urine osmolality and plasma ADH levels will usually lead to an accurate diagnosis. Central diabetes insipidus is effectively treated with replacement of free water deficits and exogenous ADH analogues.\n",

      "Adipsic diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of intracranial tumors in which impaired antidiuretic hormone secretion is associated with the loss of thirst sensation. Here, we present the case of a patient with bifocal intracranial germinoma, diagnosed due to symptoms mainly caused by adipsic diabetes insipidus. This is, to our knowledge, the first case of adipsic diabetes insipidus revealing an intracranial germinoma reported in the literature. We describe the diagnostic procedures and the three-year follow-up of this patient. Management of intracranial germ-cell tumors is made complex by the wide range of histological features. Although germinomas have a generally better prognosis than most nongerminomatous tumors, they can have severe or even life-threatening presentations. Adipsic diabetes insipidus is one such severe presentation and its rarity can make it difficult to recognize and manage. Awareness of this potential entity is therefore important for clinical practice.\n",

      "Drug-induced diabetes insipidus is always of the nephrogenic type, i.e. unresponsiveness of the kidneys to the action of antidiuretic hormone. This condition is easily diagnosed by measuring urinary concentrating capacity during a thirst test (e.g. 12 hours of water deprivation) or by administration of a modified antidiuretic hormone, desmopressin, to demonstrate the renal unresponsiveness. Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is not a common disorder except in patients receiving treatment with lithium salts for affective disorders where it may affect about 10% of patients treated long term (15 years). Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by other drugs usually occurs in critically ill patients in intensive care units receiving a multitude of drugs dominated by antimicrobials and cytostatics. A search of the World Health Organization's adverse effect database revealed 359 reports of drug-induced diabetes insipidus. Lithium was the most common cause (159 reports) followed by foscarnet (15) and clozapine (10). Treatment is symptomatic in most patients and the offending drug should be stopped. If urine volumes exceed 4 L/day, treatment with thiazides and amiloride has been advocated, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, may be tried in severe cases. Prevention of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is an important aspect of the treatment of affective disorders. In patients treated long term it appears to be only partly reversible upon lithium discontinuation. Close monitoring of the treatment aiming at 12-hour trough value of 0.4 to 0.6 mmol/L is recommended. Yearly measurement of the urinary volume/day is effective in making both the patient and the physician aware of the development of the drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The condition is a serious adverse effect because of the risk of developing dehydration and aggravation of drug intoxications.\n",

Plasma oxytocin levels were normal and ranged from less than 0.25 microU/ml to 76 microU/ml during the last month of pregnancy and during spontaneous labor. Vasopressin requirements did not change during pregnancy. Unexplained vasopressin resistance and massive diuresis occurred early in the postpartum period. Plasma vasopressin concentrations were undetectable in the nonpregnant state. The documentation of normal oxytocin production and total vasopressin deficiency suggests that an anatomic defect is unlikely to cause this disorder unless it is limited to axons and cell bodies containing vasopressin and not oxytocin.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus, characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, is a rare disease during pregnancy. Nevertheless, its recognition is important to avoid complications due to dehydration and hypernatremia. Its manifestation during pregnancy ranges from exacerbation of pre-existing central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus to transient pregnancy-induced diabetes insipidus due to the increased metabolism of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) by the placental vasopressinase. Diagnosis can be challenging, as urinary frequency is common during pregnancy and primary polydipsia also needs to be excluded. Also, the standard water deprivation test is not recommended during pregnancy due to the increased risk of complications. Treatment depends upon the final diagnosis, with desmopressin (DDAVP) being the medication of choice in AVP-deficient diabetes insipidus, whereas nephrogenic diabetes insipidus requires treatment of the underlying disease and supportive measures.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is an uncommon disorder of water-electrolyte balance characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and increased fluid intake (polydipsia). The disease may result from the insufficient production of vasopressin, its increased degradation, an impaired response of kidneys to vasopressin, or may be secondary to excessive water intake. Patients with severe and uncompensated symptoms may develop marked dehydration, neurologic symptoms and encephalopathy, and therefore diabetes insipidus can be a life-threatening condition if not properly diagnosed and managed. Patients with diabetes insipidus require treatment with desmopressin or drugs increasing sensitivity of the distal nephron to vasopressin, but this treatment may be confusing because of the disorder's variable pathophysiology and side-effects of pharmacotherapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge on different aspects of the pathophysiology, classification, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of diabetes insipidus. The reader is also provided with some practical recommendations on dealing with patients suffering from this disease.\n",

      "Hereditary diabetes insipidus can occur in two forms: the first, referred to as central diabetes insipidus, is responsive to vasopressin whereas the second, termed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, is resistant to treatment. Recent advances in molecular genetics have contributed to elucidate the pathogenesis of these affections. Familial central diabetes insipidus depicts two unsimilar illnesses. The first, characterized by an autosomal dominant transmission, is of delayed onset and worsens progressively all through life. It is related to a heterozygous mutation of the vasopressin precursor gene mainly involving either the sequence encoding for the signal peptide or the one encoding for neurophysin II, the hormone carrier protein. Mutations described to date are responsible for impairment of vasopressin precursor transportation and processing. Therefore mutant protein accumulates in the posterior pituitary which is involved in the persistant bright spot seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The second illness or Wolfram syndrome, autosomal recessive, associates obligatory features: insulin-dependant diabetes, bilateral optic atrophy and more inconstantly: diabetes insipidus, deafness, genito-urinary and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The cause of this syndrome, still unknown, may involve mitochondrial ADN mutations. Familial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, of neonatal onset, are mainly X-linked and associated to mutations in the V2 receptor gene. About 60 mutations have been described until now. Some rare cases, transmission of which is autosomal recessive, result from homozygous mutations of aquaporin 2 gene, a water channel involved in the water reabsorption in the renal collecting duct. Other mutations will be probably discovered in future. In conclusion, familial diabetes insipidus constitutes an interesting pathogenic model because it may be explained by impairment of vasopressin gene precursor as well as by abnormalities of renal receptor or post receptor mechanisms of the hormone.\n",

      "In the majority of cases, hereditary neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI) is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the AVP gene. Dominant transmission is by far the most common form. In these patients, symptoms develop gradually at various ages during childhood, progressing with complete penetrance to polyuria and polydipsia that is usually severe. In autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal DI (ADNDI), the mutant prohormone is folding deficient and consequently retained in the ER, where it forms amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates. Degradation by proteasomes occurs, but their clearance capacity appears to be insufficient. Postmortem studies in affected individuals suggest a neurodegenerative process confined to vasopressinergic neurons. Other forms of genetic neurohypophyseal DI include the very rare autosomal recessive type, also caused by mutations in the AVP gene, and complex multiorgan disorders, such as Wolfram syndrome. In all individuals where a congenital form of DI is suspected, including nephrogenic types, genetic analysis should be performed.\n",

      "Direct measurement of plasma AVP and indirect assessment of antidiuretic activity during standard dehydration tests were made in 21 polyuric and polydipsic patients to establish the efficacy of each method in determining the cause of polyuria. Patients with acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (e.g. diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hypercalcaemia) were excluded from the study. Cranial diabetes insipidus was diagnosed by plasma AVP responses to osmotic stimulation during infusion of hypertonic 5% saline which were subnormal in 13 patients, 4 of whom had undetectable plasma AVP and 3 who had reduced but osmoregulated AVP release. Standard water deprivation tests confirmed cranial diabetes insipidus in all but 2 patients who were diagnosed as partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The remaining 8 patients had normal, osmoregulated AVP secretion; the cause of their polyuria was determined by their renal response to desmopressin. Two patients had nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and 6 had primary polydipsia. The majority of polyuric patients could be accurately diagnosed by carefully performed dehydration tests. We suggest that direct measurements of plasma AVP during osmotic stimulation are only necessary to distinguish mild forms of cranial from nephrogenic diabetes, or to define precisely the characteristics of AVP secretion.\n",

      "Purpose: Diabetes insipidus (DI) following transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) is a common complication. Although postoperative DI often occurs in patients with craniopharyngioma and Rathke's cleft cyst, postoperative DI in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) has not been fully examined. We clarified the clinical characteristics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings predicting postoperative DI in NFPAs.\n",
      "Methods: A total of 333 patients undergoing initial TSS for NFPA were included in this retrospective study. Hyperintensity (HI) in the posterior pituitary lobe was evaluated on preoperative T1-weighted MRI. Based on the findings of HI patients were divided into three groups as follows: HI was not detected (Disappearance group), HI located intrasellarly (Intrasellar group), and HI located suprasellarly (Suprasellar group).\n",
      "Results: The overall rate of DI was 21.9%, including permanent DI in 0.6%. DI occurred at postoperative day 1 (72.6%) or day 2 (19.2%) and improved within 7 days in most cases (87.7%). Univariable and multivariable analyses showed that the predictive factors of DI were a younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.99, P = 0.0037) and larger tumor diameter (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, P = 0.0155). The rate of DI was highest in the Disappearance group (43.8%) followed by the Intrasellar group (26.0%). The OR was 2.17 in the Intrasellar group compared with the Suprasellar group (95% CI 1.17-4.02, P = 0.0141).\n",
      "Conclusions: Factors predicting DI following TSS for NFPA were a younger age, larger tumor size, and the location of intrasellar HI on preoperative T1-weighted MRI.\n",

A diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was confirmed and the MRI showed a pituitary stalk enlargement. The patient was treated with Minirin. Two years later, she developed a panhypopituitarism. The MRI showed an intrasellar mass with an enlargement of the pituitary gland. A biopsy confirmed a germinoma. The patient was treated with radiotherapy with a partial response as only a part of the mass disappeared.

The heifer was referred to the clinic because of reduced appetite, polydipsia, decreased faecal output and weight loss. The heifer was examined daily for 8 days. She was thin and weak and had a dull dry hair coat and decreased appetite. The heifer urinated frequently; the urine was clear and yel low, had a specific gravity of 1.015. A complete blood cell count, biochemical profile and blood gas analysis revealed increased serum urea, increased serum creatinine, hypernatraemia, hyperchloraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypophosphataemia. The heifer received 10 litres of water and 3 litres of ruminal fluid from a healthy cow per os daily for 5 days. The heifer had access to fresh water ad libitum. The general condition of the heifer did not improve after this treatment. Although the concentration of serum urea and creatinine decreased, the concentrations of sodium, chloride and calcium remained higher than normal. Based on the findings, a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was made and the heifer was euthanatized. Postmortem examination revealed severe internal hydrocephalus, and a definitive diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus attributable to internal hydrocephalus was made.\n",

      "Chronic diabetes mellitus (DM) induces hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Our present study addresses the role of vasopressin (AVP) in maintaining adrenocortical responsiveness during DM. AVP-deficient mutant Brattleboro rats were used with heterozygous controls and the V2 agonist, desmopressin was infused to replace peripheral AVP. To induce DM the rats were injected by streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/ml/kg i.v.) and studied 2 weeks later. The acute stress stimulus was 60 min restraint. The signs of DM (the increase in water consumption and in blood glucose levels) were discovered in all rats. The diuretic effect of the lack of AVP was additional to the DM-induced osmotic diuresis. DM induced significant, chronic stress-like somatic changes on which AVP-deficiency had no effect and although desmopressin infusion normalized the water consumption and the body weight gain in AVP-deficient rats, it had no effect on DM-induced changes. The acute stress-induced plasma ACTH elevation was smaller in AVP-deficient or DM rats but these effects were not additive. Desmopressin did not normalize the decreased ACTH-elevation of AVP-deficient animals. The resting morning plasma corticosterone level was elevated both in DM and AVP-deficient rats without interaction. The restraint-induced corticosterone rise was influenced neither by the lack of AVP nor by DM and the basal and stress-induced prolactin levels were smaller in DM rats without any effect of AVP-deficiency. In conclusion, our data suggest that AVP does not play a crucial role in HPA axis regulation during DM-induced chronic stress. In contrast, the role of AVP seems to be more important during acute stress, however, it is restricted to the ACTH regulation. According to the water consumption data diabetes insipidus seems to be an additional risk factor for DM.\n",

      "Background: Diabetes insipidus is uncommon in pregnancy. Despite physiological modifications in hydroelectrolytic balance during normal pregnancy, the capacity of the kidney to concentrate urine is preserved, partially due to lower vasopressin secretion.\n",
      "Case report: A young woman developed diabetes insipidus during the third trimester of normal pregnancy. The disease regressed totally after delivery. However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a persistent expansive intrasellar image with a high-intensity signal.\n",
      "Discussion: Onset of diabetes insipidus is usually rapidly progressive in pregnancy. Occurring generally during the third trimester in normal pregnancies, diabetes insipidus is generally well tolerated and responds to dDAVP, usually without pituitary abnormally, and regresses after delivery. Two types are distinguished: partially latent diabetes insipidus occurring during pregnancy and due to a central rather than nephrogenic origin; and excessive vasopressinase activity leading to diabetes insipidus usually associated with liver anomalies and high frequency of pre-eclampsia. During normal pregnancy, the size of the anterior pituitary increases and the normal high-intensity signal in the posterior pituitary seen on MRI usually regresses or disappears. In diabetes insipidus, the posterior pituitary hypersignal image generally disappears, reflecting reduced vasopressin storage. Few observations of diabetes insipidus occurring during pregnancy have been reported with morphological explorations. Most have described a \"normal\" aspect of the pituitary, specifically in the post partum period. In our patient, the weak vasopressin response to the end of water restriction at post partum when the diabetes insipidus symptoms had disappeared would suggest partial central diabetes insipidus revealed by pregnancy. Other pathologies involving this region could also be involved due to the unusual and persistent sellar image, with an expansive process showing a high intensity signal on MRI. An asymptomatic craniopharyngioma cyst was hypothesized and would be more compatible with the observed symptoms.\n",

      "Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.\n",

Substitutive therapy induces a general improvement of the scores, mainly in the patients who did show the lower performances before treatment. Although our results are in agreement with positive action of vasopressin on mnesic function, we cannot ascertained that the observed effect is solely due to a central action of the hormone, since some metabolic consequences of the hormone administration (i.e. relapse of nycturia and consequently of sleep disturbances) could have indirect effects of cognitive function.\n",

WS is variably associated with diabetes insipidus, neurological disorders, urinary tract anomalies, endocrine dysfunctions and many other systemic manifestations. Since Wolfram and Wagener first described WS in 1938, new phenotypic/genotypic variants of the syndrome have been observed and the clinical picture has been significantly enriched. To date, two main subtypes of WS that associated with two different mutations are known: WS type 1 (WS1), caused by the mutation of the wolframine gene (WS1; 606201), and WS type 2 (WS2), caused by the mutation of the CISD2 gene (WS2; 604928).\n",

Although in Spanish pedigrees' WFS1 mutations are frequently located in exon 4, this finding is very infrequent in other pedigrees, particularly in Italian patients.\n",
      "Conclusions: a) our report of two siblings with one novel WSF1 mutation (G107R) expands the molecular spectrum of WS; b) this is the 3rd report of Italian patients harbouring one mutation outside exon 8 and the 2nd with one mutation in exon 4; c) on the basis of the present observations, and literature data we can infer that mutation locations outside exon 8 do not seem to be clearly associated with peculiar phenotype expressions of WFS1 gene.\n",

      "Background: Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness identified by the acronym \"DIDMOAD\". The WS gene, WFS1, encodes a transmembrane protein called Wolframin, which recent evidence suggests may serve as a novel endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel in pancreatic β-cells and neurons. WS is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1/550.000 children, with a carrier frequency of 1/354. The aim of our study was to determine the genotype of WS patients in order to establish a genotype/phenotype correlation.\n",
      "Methodology/principal findings: We clinically evaluated 9 young patients from 9 unrelated families (6 males, 3 females). Basic criteria for WS clinical diagnosis were coexistence of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy occurring before 15 years of age. Genetic analysis for WFS1 was performed by direct sequencing. Molecular sequencing revealed 5 heterozygous compound and 3 homozygous mutations. All of them were located in exon 8, except one in exon 4. In one proband only an heterozygous mutation (A684V) was found. Two new variants c.2663 C>A and c.1381 A>C were detected.\n",
      "Conclusions/significance: Our study increases the spectrum of WFS1 mutations with two novel variants. The male patient carrying the compound mutation [c.1060_1062delTTC]+[c.2663 C>A] showed the most severe phenotype: diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy (visual acuity 5/10), deafness with deep auditory bilaterally 8000 Hz, diabetes insipidus associated to reduced volume of posterior pituitary and pons. He died in bed at the age of 13 years. The other patient carrying the compound mutation [c.409_424dup16]+[c.1381 A>C] showed a less severe phenotype (DM, OA).\n",

      "Purpose: Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is a rare disorder characterized by childhood-onset progressive polyuria and polydipsia due to mutations in the arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of families with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "Methods: Five Portuguese families with autosomal dominant FNDI underwent sequencing of the AVP gene and the identified mutations were functionally characterized by in vitro studies.\n",
      "Results: Three novel and two recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in the AVP gene. These consisted of one initiation codon mutation in the signal peptide coding region (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), three missense mutations in the neurophysin II (NPII) coding region (c.154T > C, p.Cys52Arg; c.289C > G, p.Arg97Gly; and c.293G > C, p.Cys98Ser), and one nonsense mutation in the NPII coding region (c.343G > T, p.Glu115Ter). In vitro transfection of neuronal cells with expression vectors containing each mutation showed that the mutations resulted in intracellular retention of the vasopressin prohormone. Patients showed progressive symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia, but with wide variability in severity and age at onset. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation was observed.\n",
      "Conclusion: The intracellular accumulation of mutant vasopressin precursors supports the role of cellular toxicity of the mutant proteins in the etiology of the disorder and explains the progressive onset of the disorder. These findings further expand the AVP mutational spectrum in FNDI and contribute to the understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms involved in FNDI.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is not generally recognized as a possible cause of etiologically obscure fever. We describe a female patient who presented with fever and polyuria and was shown to have idiopathic partial neurogenic diabetes insipidus. The fever was subsequently demonstrated to be caused by diabetes insipidus per se. The mechanism for the production of fever in this patient was most likely a defect in peripheral heat dissipation secondary to inadequate hydration. We conclude that diabetes insipidus is another cause of hormonal hyperthermia and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of etiologically obscure fever.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome (WFS), or DIDMOAD, is a rare (1/100 000 to 1/770 000), progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In its early stages, it is characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and loss of sensorineural hearing-this is followed by diabetes insipidus, progressive neurological abnormalities and other endocrine abnormalities, which occur in later years. The aim of this study was to report on the clinical and electrophysiological findings from a family with the WFS1 mutation. The five family members were subjected to a complete ophthalmic examination, which included a flash full-field electroretinogram and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PVEPs) performed according to ISCEV standards. Optic atrophy was confirmed in two homozygotic patients, where P100 latencies were significantly delayed-up to 146 ms in PVEP. P100 latencies were normal in the three heterozygotic patients we examined. Curve morphology abnormalities were observed in all five patients we examined. No literature describing the morphology of PVEP in Wolfram syndrome patients was found. In flash electroretinography, scotopic and photopic responses appeared in normal morphology and value. Diabetic retinopathy was not observed in the diabetes mellitus patients.\n",

We have treated two children with central DI, revealed during the neonatal period, successively with an intranasal preparation of desmopressin at one month of age and with an oral preparation at one and 3 years respectively. We conclude that oral treatment with desmopressin is possible, secure and effective in DI presenting in the first months of life. This new form of administration seems even better for younger children when the difficulties of intranasal administration can be responsible for severe complications. As with the intranasal form, the doses given orally are very variable and individual.\n",

      "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by renal resistance to the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which leads to polyuria, plasma hyperosmolarity, polydipsia, and impaired quality of living. Inherited forms are caused by X-linked loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) or autosomal recessive/dominant mutations in the gene encoding aquaporin 2 (AQP2). A common acquired form is lithium-induced NDI. AVP facilitates reabsorption of water through increased abundance and insertion of AQP2 in the apical membrane of principal cells in the collecting ducts. In X-linked NDI, V2R is dysfunctional, which leads to impaired water reabsorption. These patients have functional AQP2, and thus the challenge is to achieve AQP2 membrane insertion independently of V2R. The current treatment is symptomatic and is based on distally acting diuretics (thiazide or amiloride) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin). This mini-review covers published data from trials in preclinical in vivo models and a few human intervention studies to improve NDI by more causal approaches. Promising effects on NDI in preclinical studies have been demonstrated by the use of pharmacological approaches with secretin, Wnt5a, protein kinase A agonist, fluconazole, prostaglandin E2 EP2 and EP4 agonists, statins, metformin, and soluble prorenin receptor agonists. In patients, only casuistic reports have evaluated the effect of statins, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (rolipram and sildenafil), and the guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat without amelioration of symptoms. It is concluded that there is currently no established intervention that causally improves symptoms or quality of life in patients with NDI. There is a need to collaborate to improve study quality and conduct formal trials.\n",

      "2018 brings new insights into the differential diagnosis of patients with hypotonic polyuria syndrome. Exact localization of the antidiuretic defect in patients with hypotonic polyuria can be challenging, especially the distinction of primary polydipsia from partial pituitary or renal forms of diabetes insipidus. However, diagnostic precision is vital since therapeutic management differs substantially and false treatment may result in serious consequences.A main limitation of the indirect water deprivation test is its limited accuracy to correctly distinguish between the pathophysiologically distinct forms of hypotonic polyuria with a residual antidiuretic capacity. Direct detection of the osmotically-sensitive AVP reserve may be diagnostically superior but is technically difficult and not available for clinical routine, having left indirect diagnostic readouts the only accepted method for differentiating polyuric states, despite a diagnostic accuracy of only 70 %.New data demonstrate that selective measurement of plasma copeptin, a reliable AVP surrogate, not only captures patients with underlying renal defect, but critically improves diagnostic differentiation between primary polydipsia and pituitary forms of central diabetes insipidus.This manuscript presents the novel findings in the field and interprets their clinical consequences.\n",

      "Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a rare hereditary disease characterized by a renal insensitivity to circulating vasopressin. Genetic linkage studies have demonstrated that the gene responsible for congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is located in region 28 of the X chromosome long arm. That the gene coding for the vasopressin V2 receptor is also located in the q28-qter of chromosome X suggests that the signalisation defect in congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is at the level of the receptor itself. Indeed, congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a genetically heterogeneous disease since several point mutations in the vasopressin V2 receptor gene nucleotide sequence have been observed in different families of afflicted patients. Moreover, the observation that one of these mutations leads to a lack of cyclic AMP production in response to vasopressin confirms that mutations of the vasopressin V2 receptor sequence are the molecular defects responsible for congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "Twelve patients, aged 16-66 years, affected by cranial diabetes insipidus either idiopathic or secondary (head injuries, histiocytosis X, metastatic tumors, pituitary or hypothalamic surgery) were studied. Diagnosis was made on the basis of both dehydration test and sensitivity to exogenous vasopressin. The relationship between plasma and urine osmolality at the end of the dehydration test was evaluated (and its usefulness for diagnostic purpose confirmed). According to this test two different conditions, namely partial and complete, of cranial diabetes insipidus were defined. All the patients underwent the following diagnostic procedures: skull x-ray, evaluation of visual fields, encephalic CT-scan. Idiopathic central diabetes insipidus incidence was found to be 33.3% of all cases, with a sharp prevalence for male sex; the median age of onset was 12.5 years. In our experience the frequency of idiopathic condition was similar to that reported in most recent literature confirming a decreasing incidence, most likely due to the use of more sophisticated diagnostic procedures.\n",

      "Wolfram's syndrome is defined by the association of diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy and nerve deafness. Other neurological anomalies, such as ataxia, nystagmus, tonic pupil, dizziness, dysarthria, dysphagia and epilepsy are rarely described and tend to appear later than the primary manifestations. We describe a patient with Wolfram's syndrome whose magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the head showed brainstem and cerebellar atrophy years before the appearance of clinical signs of brainstem disfunction. We conclude that alterations in MRI precede neurological symptoms by several years in Wolfram's syndrome.\n",

      "We encountered a pregnant woman with transient diabetes insipidus which developed during the third trimester. A hypertonic saline infusion study did not concentrate the osmolality of urine. Her laboratory data showed hypokalemia, hyperreninemia, an increased concentration of plasma aldosterone and an increased urinary excretion rate of prostaglandin E2, which resembled hyperprostaglandin E-syndrome. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior pituitary gland revealed decreased intensity. Polyuria reached 4-6 L daily, and urine osmolality remained dilute despite a lapse of four days since treatment with intranasal 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP: 10-25 microg every 12 h). The patient was conservatively managed without medical treatment, then delivered in the 38th week of pregnancy without complication. The osmolality of the patient's urine was higher than that of the plasma when tested 3 days postpartum. The abnormality of magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior pituitary gland disappeared at 6 months after delivery. We consider that subclinical nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in our patient was exacerbated during pregnancy.\n",

      "Twenty cases of familial ADH-responsive diabetes insipidus were identified within five generations, and eight patients were studied by one of two established dehydration protocols. In each case there was partial to total failure of response to the initial administration of ADH which was slowly corrected by continued administration. This initial failure can lead to misinterpretation of the dehydration test unless the medullary solute washout effect is taken into account in chronically polyuric patients.Treatment consisted of thiazides and/or chlorpropamide. All cases responded well.The response to chlorpropamide suggests that the failure of ADH production is not complete in these patients, and that the major defect is a failure of ADH release in response to normal stimuli. Chlorpropamide may act by either facilitating ADH release or by synergistically interacting with available ADH at the tubular level.\n",

      "Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by several symptoms that occur from childhood to adulthood. Usually, the first clinical sign is non-autoimmune diabetes even if other clinical features (optic subatrophy, neurosensorial deafness, diabetes insipidus) may be present in an early state and may be diagnosed after diabetes' onset. Prognosis is poor, and the death occurs at the median age of 39 years as a consequence of progressive respiratory impairment, secondary to brain atrophy and neurological failure. The aim of this paper is the description of the metabolic treatment of the WS. We reported the experience of long treatment in patients with this syndrome diagnosed in pediatric age and followed also in adult age. It is known that there is a correlation between metabolic control of diabetes, the onset of other associated symptoms, and the progression of the neurodegenerative alterations. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to prevent, treat and carefully monitor all the comorbidities that may occur. An extensive understanding of WS from pathophysiology to novel possible therapy is fundamental and further studies are needed to better manage this devastating disease and to guarantee to patients a better quality of life and a longer life expectancy.\n",

      "Background: Water and electrolyte disorders commonly encountered in children post-surgery involving hypothalamus and posterior pituitary, are central diabetes insipidus, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone and cerebral salt wasting disease. Delayed diagnosis and inadequate management of such cases may lead to worsened neurological outcomes with a high mortality rate.\n",
      "Case presentation: Here we report the case of a 7-year-old girl who underwent surgical resection of a craniopharyngioma, following which she initially developed central diabetes insipidus. However, later on in the course of her illness she developed symptomatic hyponatremia with natriuresis which was diagnosed to be due to cerebral salt wasting disease. This combination of central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome is a rare occurrence and poses a diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis and management can be even more difficult when these conditions precede or coexist with each other.\n",
      "Conclusion: In such cases development of hyponatremia should always prompt consideration of unusual causes like cerebral salt wasting disease in addition to the classically described syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Hence, a thorough knowledge of these disorders along with intensive monitoring of fluid and sodium status is critical for timely diagnosis and management of these patients.\n",

      "Wolfram syndrome 1, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene. It is characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness (DIDMOAD), and other clinical manifestations such as urological and neurological disorders. Here we described the case of a patient with an atypical late-onset Wolfram syndrome 1 without DI. Our WS1 patient was a c.1620_1622delGTG (p.Trp540del)/c.124 C > T (p.Arg42*) heterozygous compound. The p.Arg42* nonsense mutation was also found in heterozygosity in his sister and niece, both suffering from psychiatric disorders. The p.Arg42* nonsense mutation has never been found in WS1 and its pathogenicity is unclear so far. Our study underlined the need to study a greater number of WS1 cases in order to better understand the clinical significance of many WFS1 variants.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is a clinical syndrome characterized by the excretion of copious volumes of dilute urine combined with persistent intake of abnormally large quantities of fluid. There are two general forms of the disease, central (vasopressin deficient) and nephrogenic (vasopressin resistant). Diabetes insipidus of central origin most often results from lesions in the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis. Twenty-six cases of central diabetes insipidus were evaluated with the use of high-field-strength MR imaging. A wide variety of precipitating conditions were found, including Langerhans cell histiocytosis, neoplasia, trauma, and infection. A thickened pituitary infundibulum was seen in most patients, and an absence of high intensity signal in the posterior pituitary lobe on T1-weighted images was seen in every case. Analysis of stalk morphology; associated brain findings; and correlation with the patient's age, sex, history, and radiographs of other body parts improved diagnostic specificity. When combined with clinical information, MR imaging is able to provide a specific diagnosis in almost all cases of central diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "In order to investigate the possible role of oxytocin in osmoregulation and its response to stress, plasma immunoreactive oxytocin was measured during hypertonic saline infusion and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in a group of normal subjects, four patients with idiopathic diabetes insipidus and one patient with DIDMOAD syndrome (the syndrome of diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness). The results were compared with those of plasma immunoreactive vasopressin to the same stimuli. As expected, there was a rise in plasma vasopressin in the normal subjects to both tests: this was absent in the patients with diabetes insipidus. Plasma oxytocin did not rise during hypertonic saline infusion in either group of subjects. The response of oxytocin to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (0.15 U/kg soluble insulin) in normal subjects was much more variable. One highly symptomatic volunteer showed a marked rise in oxytocin. Two subjects also showed a rise when retested with 0.19 U/kg soluble insulin. There was no response of oxytocin to a standard-dose insulin test in the patients with diabetes insipidus. The data suggest that, in man, oxytocin is not involved in osmoregulation but that it may be secreted in response to marked hypoglycaemia.\n",

      "There have only been thirty cases of total post-partum hypopituitarism published in the literature and these have nearly all been secondary to Sheehan's syndrome. The authors report a case of partial anterior hypopituitarism associated with diabetes insipidus which arose after an uneventful Caesarean operation and the origin of which seems to lie in auto-immune hypophysitis. The authors first describe the morphological and endocrine changes that the hypophysis undergoes during pregnancy and then point out that auto-immune hypophysitis seems to have been only recently recognised. This can be used to explain some cases of post-partum hypophyseal insufficiency occurring almost silently without any history of third haemorrhage. Research has been made systematically for anti-hypophyseal antibodies and for specific antibodies of the organ, but has not always been positive. So the diagnosis of auto-immune hypophysitis is often made only after eliminating other reasons for it. A brief review of the physiopathological mechanisms of diabetes insipidus makes it possible to suggest that vasopressinase coming from the placenta together with prostaglandins could play a role.\n",

      "Water homeostasis in the body is finely balanced by the release of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin and the stimulation of thirst. Vasopressin acts in the kidneys to concentrate urine and reduce plasma osmolality. Diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance characterized by a failure to concentrate urine. There are two types of diabetes insipidus: central and nephrogenic. Central diabetes insipidus is caused by insufficient production of vasopressin, while nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an impaired response of the kidneys to vasopressin. Patients with central diabetes insipidus respond to treatment with vasopressin or its synthetic analogue, desmopressin; however, caution should be utilized in treating infants with vasopressin or analogues-infants can be treated successfully with fluids alone. Treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus involves removing the underlying cause, if possible, reducing solute load or therapy with a diuretic agent.\n",

      "Background: Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is known to involve diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, vision loss, hearing impairment, motor abnormalities, and neurodegeneration, but has been less clearly linked to cognitive, sleep, and psychiatric abnormalities. We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are present in children, adolescents, and young adults with WFS compared to age- and gender-matched individuals with and without type 1 diabetes using standardized measures.\n",
      "Methods: Individuals with genetically-confirmed WFS (n = 19, ages 7-27) were compared to age- and gender- equivalent groups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 25), and non-diabetic healthy controls (HC: n = 25). Cognitive performance across multiple domains (verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, memory, attention, smell identification) was assessed using standardized tests. Standardized self- and parent-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances were acquired from all groups and an unstructured psychiatric interview was performed within only the WFS group.\n",
      "Results: The three groups were similar demographically (age, gender, ethnicity, parental IQ). WFS and T1DM had similar duration of diabetes but T1DM had higher HbA1C levels than WFS and as expected both groups had higher levels than HC. The WFS group was impaired on smell identification and reported sleep quality, but was not impaired in any other cognitive or self-reported psychiatric domain. In fact, the WFS group performed better than the other two groups on selected memory and attention tasks. However, based upon a clinical evaluation of only WFS patients, we found that psychiatric and behavioral problems were present and consisted primarily of anxiety and hypersomnolence.\n",
      "Conclusions: This study found that cognitive performance and psychological health were relatively preserved WFS patients, while smell and sleep abnormalities manifested in many of the WFS patients. These findings contradict past case and retrospective reports indicating significant cognitive and psychiatric impairment in WFS. While many of these patients were diagnosed with anxiety and hypersomnolence, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms indicated that the symptoms were not of grave concern to the patients. It may be that cognitive and psychiatric issues become more prominent later in life and/or in later stages of the disease, but this requires standardized assessment and larger samples to determine. In the relatively early stages of WFS, smell and sleep-related symptoms may be useful biomarkers of disease and should be monitored longitudinally to determine if they are good markers of progression as well.\n",

      "Diabetes insipidus is seen most frequently in neurosurgical patients. The transient form is more common and usually subsides prior to discharge. Permanent DI is seen in patients with extensive damage in the hypothalamic area. Treatment of either form of DI is usually with a preparation of vasopressin. Nursing assessements and interventions are crucial to a successful outcome in patients with this disorder. Health teaching for patients with permanent DI is an integral part of the nursing responsibility.\n",

      "Females from two inbred strains of chickens, one normal and one having hereditary diabetes insipidus, were treated with five levels (2.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 units) of Schwartz-Mann (Grade A, 100 units/mg.) arginine vasotocin via ic. injections at 2-hr. intervals. Paired sibs, one normal and one having diabetes insipidus (di), from an F2 population were used in one experiment to compare responses at the level of 2.5 units. Only di females were used for the remaining four levels of treatment. Water intake was determined every two hours and calculated as a percentage of water (ml.)/body wt. Results show that hereditary diabetes insipidus in chickens is arginine vasotocin-sensitive at the 0.5 unit and higher levels. The genetic defect appears to affect the quantity of antidiuretic hormone produced.\n",

      "Although water alone taken in sufficient amount should correct any metabolic abnormality, a proper therapy is available to reduce the symptoms of the diabetes insipidus. In patients with reduced circulating levels of vasopressin, chlorpropamide, clofibrate, idroclorotiazide etc., enhance the effect of vasopressin on the renal tubule or induce a release of vasopressin, thus reducing the diuresis. On the contrary patients with complete diabetes insipidus require replacement therapy. Different forms of extractive vasopressin unfortunately are available: \"aqueous vasopressin\", \"tannate vasopressin\" in a suspension of peanut oil etc., are provided of many side-effects because of the impurities in their preparation. DDAVP is a synthetic analogous of natural vasopressin more specific for antidiuresis and with a long-activity. This compound available in a buffered aqueous solution is administrated by blowing into the nose. In our experience, 23 patients with different forms of central diabetes insipidus have successfully treated with 2-3 daily administrations of this drug without any side effect. The recent demonstration that DDAVP given orally exerts an antidiuretic activity in patients with diabetes insipidus is of therapeutic interest. It is conceivable that DDAVP in a properly formulated tablet will become a therapeutic option for the future treatment of patients with central diabetes insipidus.\n",

      "Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a rare, hereditary in nature, characterized by an inability of the kidney to concentrate urine, secondary to the manifold resistance to the action of vasopressin. X-linked forms of transmission (90%) are expressed in boys, from the neonatal period in general, by polyuria and polydipsia. Symptomatology in transmissive girls is variable but can sometimes be quite marked. These forms are secondary to mutations in the gene encoding the vasopressin V2 receptor, located at position Xq28, responsible for a loss of function of this receptor. Some of these mutations may cause a partial phenotype, less severe. Forms of autosomal, recessive or dominant are more rare (10%). Treatment is symptomatic, sometimes difficult in infants. It aims to avoid episodes of dehydration. It is based on a conventional diet hypo-osmotic and administration of hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin. We report here the case of a child with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Rabat and throughout this case we review the pathophysiology and clinical and biological characteristics of the disease and including importance of contribution of clinical biochemistry laboratory in the diagnosis and monitoring of this disease.\n",

      "We simplified the procedures for identifying children with diabetes insipidus by using the relationship between urine and plasma osmolality (Uosm and Posm). We defined the normal Uosm-Posm relationship as the area within the 95% confidence regions for pairs of osmolality measurements obtained from normal children during periods of free access to fluids and after oral hydration. In 13 patients with diabetes insipidus, Uosm-Posm coordinates were outside these regions in 50 of 64 pairs (one to ten per patient) during periods of free access to fluids. After three hours of fluid deprivation, the Uosm-Posm relationship was abnormal in 12 patients; the 13th was unable to void. For those with a normal Posm, and Uosm less than Posm, another pair of osmolality measurements after three hours of fluid restriction should determine the diagnosis.\n",

      "Objective: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is released upon osmotic stimulation or hypovolaemia in order to maintain water balance. A recent study showed a role of AVP in haematopoiesis by stimulating red blood cell precursors, suggesting a higher risk of anaemia in patients with AVP deficiency. The objective was to explore the effect of low AVP levels in patients with central diabetes insipidus (cDI) and primary polydipsia (PP) on haemoglobin and the prevalence of anaemia.\n",
      "Methods: A total of 164 patients with either cDI (70, 43%) or PP (94, 57%) and 30 healthy volunteers from two prospective diagnostic studies performed in Switzerland, Germany and Brazil were studied. A standardized clinical and biochemical (eg copeptin, full blood count) assessment was performed. Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels and prevalence of anaemia (defined as haemoglobin values of <120 g/L in women and <130 g/L in men) were analysed.\n",
      "Results: Mean copeptin values were 2.63 pmol/L (±1.08) and 3.91 pmol/L (±4.28) in patients with cDI and PP and 24.76 pmol/L (±5.75) in healthy volunteers, P = .02. The prevalence of anaemia was low in all participants with 7.1%, 2.2% and 10% in cDI, PP and in healthy volunteers, P = .15. Mean haemoglobin values were similar in all groups: 139 g/L (±15.85), 140 g/L (±13.16) and 139 g/L (±13.05) in patients with cDI, PP and healthy volunteers, P = .90, as were mean haematocrit values with 41% in all groups (P = .85).\n",
