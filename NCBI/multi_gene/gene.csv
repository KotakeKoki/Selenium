"Kcnj11 potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 [ Mus musculus (house mouse) ]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/16514,protein coding,mBIR; Kir6.2,"Enables ATP binding activity; ATP-activated inward rectifier potassium channel activity; and ankyrin binding activity. Involved in potassium ion import across plasma membrane. Located in T-tubule. Part of inward rectifying potassium channel. Is expressed in several structures, including brain; cardiovascular system; gut; skeletal muscle tissue; and testis. Used to study permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Human ortholog(s) of this gene implicated in familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia 2 and glucose metabolism disease (multiple). Orthologous to human KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 11). [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]",7 B3; 7 29.66 cM
Pparg peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma [ Mus musculus (house mouse) ],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/19016,protein coding,Nr1c3; PPARgamma; PPAR-gamma; PPARgamma2; PPAR-gamma2,"This gene encodes a nuclear receptor protein belonging to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar) family. The encoded protein is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptors and binds to DNA motifs termed ""peroxisome proliferator response elements"" to either activate or inhibit gene expression. Mice lacking the encoded protein die at an embryonic stage due to severe defects in placental vascularization. When the embryos lacking this gene are supplemented with healthy placentas, the mutants survive to term, but succumb to lipodystrophy and multiple hemorrhages. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2015]",6 E3; 6 53.41 cM
