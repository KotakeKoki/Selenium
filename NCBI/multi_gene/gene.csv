IGF1 insulin like growth factor 1 [ Homo sapiens (human) ],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3479,protein coding,IGF; MGF; IGFI; IGF-I,"The protein encoded by this gene is similar to insulin in function and structure and is a member of a family of proteins involved in mediating growth and development. The encoded protein is processed from a precursor, bound by a specific receptor, and secreted. Defects in this gene are a cause of insulin-like growth factor I deficiency. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar processing to generate mature protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]",12q23.2
TP53 tumor protein p53 [ Homo sapiens (human) ],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157,protein coding,P53; BCC7; LFS1; BMFS5; TRP53,"This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons from identical transcript variants (PMIDs: 12032546, 20937277).

KCNQ1 potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 [ Homo sapiens (human) ],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3784,protein coding,LQT; RWS; WRS; LQT1; SQT2; ATFB1; ATFB3; JLNS1; KCNA8; KCNA9; Kv1.9; Kv7.1; KVLQT1,"This gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel required for repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. This protein can form heteromultimers with two other potassium channel proteins, KCNE1 and KCNE3. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary long QT syndrome 1 (also known as Romano-Ward syndrome), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, and familial atrial fibrillation. This gene exhibits tissue-specific imprinting, with preferential expression from the maternal allele in some tissues, and biallelic expression in others. This gene is located in a region of chromosome 11 amongst other imprinted genes that are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), and itself has been shown to be disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements in patients with BWS. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]",11p15.5-p15.4
FGF14 fibroblast growth factor 14 [ Homo sapiens (human) ],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2259,protein coding,FHF4; FHF-4; SCA27; FGF-14,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. A mutation in this gene is associated with autosomal dominant cerebral ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]",13q33.1
